<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
[Transcriber's Note: This book contains much Greek text, which will not be
well-rendered in plain text versions of this E-book. Also, there is much use of
Greek characters with a vertical bar across the tops of the letters to indicate
abbreviations; because the coding system used in this e-book does not have such an
<span class="tei tei-q">“overline”</span>, they are rendered here with underlines. It also contains much text
in Syriac, which is written right-to-left; for the sake of different transcription
methods, it is transcribed here in both right-to-left and left-to-rights, so that
regardless of the medium of this E-book, one or the other should be readable.]
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The facts stated in the preceding volume have led us to
believe that no extant manuscript of the Greek Testament
yet discovered is older than the fourth century, and that those
written as early as the sixth century are both few in number,
and (with one notable exception) contain but incomplete portions,
for the most part very small portions, of the sacred
volume. When to these considerations we add the well-known
circumstance that the most ancient codices vary widely
and perpetually from the commonly received text and from each
other, it becomes desirable for us to obtain, if possible, some
evidence as to the character of those copies of the New Testament
which were used by the primitive Christians in times
anterior to the date of the most venerable now preserved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such sources of information, though of a more indirect and
precarious kind than manuscripts of the original can supply,
are open to us in the Versions of Holy Scripture, made at the
remotest period in the history of the Church, for the use of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
believers whose native tongue was not Greek. After the composition
of the writings of the New Testament, it is evident
that the Church was in possession of Sacred Books which were
of the utmost value, both to those who were already members,
and in the conversion of such as had not yet come to the real
knowledge of the Faith. The nearness of Syria to Judea, and
the growth of the Church at Antioch and Damascus in the
earliest days, must have produced a demand for a rendering
into the Syriac languages; and the bilingual condition of most
of the Roman Empire must have entailed a constant desire
amongst vast multitudes to read in their own tongue a verification
of the truths taught them. Accordingly translations,
certainly of the New and probably also of the Old Testament,
were executed not later than the second century in the Syriac
and Latin languages, and, so far as their present state enables
us to judge of the documents from which they were rendered,
they represent to us a modification of the inspired text which
existed within a century of the death of the Apostles. Later on,
the influence of Alexandria opened the districts to the south
and gave birth to the Coptic versions. And about the time of
the acceptance of the Christian Religion by the Empire a further
impetus was given, and the Vulgate and the Gothic and Ethiopic
versions were soon made, followed by others according as the
demand arose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, the fact that versions as a class go much further back
than MSS., constitutes one of the chiefest points of their importance
in Textual Criticism; since the range of the ancient
versions may be roughly estimated as reaching from the second to
the tenth century, whereas the period of extant MSS. did not commence
till the fourth century was well advanced, and were continued
into the sixteenth. Their respective ages, too, are actually
known, and do not rest upon probabilities, as in the first kind
of evidence. They are also generally authorized translations,
made either by a body of men, or by one eminent authority
whose work was adopted amongst the people for whose use the
Holy Scriptures had been translated. And they probably represented,
either many MSS., or a small body of accepted MSS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, versions as evidence are not without their
special drawbacks. It may be found as difficult to arrive at
the primitive text of a version, as of the Greek original itself;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whether from variations in the different copies, or from suspicions
of subsequent correction. Besides this, some are secondary
versions, being derived not from the Greek, but from some version
of the Greek. Again, some are <span class="tei tei-q">“sense-translations<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>,”</span> rather
than word-renderings, and it is in many cases difficult to infer
their real verdict. Of course, none but an expert, such as
Dr. S. C. Malan, or the several revisers of the succeeding chapters
of this edition, can pronounce upon the character of the verdict
of a version in question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be seen then that versions by themselves cannot be
taken to establish any reading, because manuscripts are
necessarily first authorities, and there is no lack of abundance
in such testimony. Yet they confirm, or help to decide, the conclusions
or the leanings of manuscriptal evidence: and taken in
connexion with other witnesses, they have much independent
force, varying of course according to the character of the version
or versions, and the nature and extent of their agreement. In
this respect they possess great importance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The experience of recent years has shown that it is misleading
to construct classes of versions in regard to their
relative importance. Fuller knowledge casts aside, and often
with contumely, such adventitious helps. Readers are therefore
referred for information upon each version to the chapter
or section which is devoted to it, and are recommended to gather
their apprehensions of the several values of those versions from
the facts recorded therein, and from use of them in the various
passages of Holy Scripture where they are cited. But the
following is a list of the chief versions of the New Testament
which were made before the introduction of printing, and a few
handposts are inserted here and there for elementary guidance
in the study of them:—

It may be added, that from the literary activity of the last ten
years in the closer examination of ancient records, and through
discoveries in Egypt and elsewhere, a great deal has been added
to the knowledge previously existing upon this part of the subject
of this book. Therefore in the succeeding chapters much
alteration has been found necessary both in the way of correction,
because some theories have been exploded under the
increased light of wider information, and by the insertion of
additions from the results of investigation and of study. The
editor has been readily and generously assisted by several accomplished
scholars who are experts in their respective departments;
and the names of the various writers who have contributed to
the four succeeding chapters will form a sufficient guarantee for
the soundness and completeness of the information therein
supplied.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Aramaean or Syriac (preserved to this day as their sacred
tongue by several Eastern Churches) is an important branch of
the great Semitic family of languages, and as early as Jacob's
age existed distinct from the Hebrew (Gen. xxxi. 47). As we
now find it in books, it was spoken in the north of Syria
and in Upper Mesopotamia about Edessa, and survives to this
day in the vernacular of the plateau to the north of Mardin and
Nisibis<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>. It is a more copious, flexible, and elegant language
than the old Hebrew (which ceased to be vernacular at the
Babylonish captivity) had ever the means of becoming, and is
so intimately akin to the Chaldee as spoken at Babylon, and
throughout Syria, that the latter was popularly known by its
name (2 Kings xviii. 26; Isa. xxxvi. 11; Dan. ii. 4)<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>. As the
Gospel took firm root at Antioch within a few years after the
Lord's Ascension (Acts xi. 19-27; xiii. 1, &amp;c.), we might deem it
probable that its tidings soon spread from the Greek capital into
the native interior, even though we utterly rejected the venerable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tradition of Thaddaeus' mission to Abgarus, toparch of
Edessa, as well as the fable of that monarch's intercourse with
Christ while yet on earth (Eusebius, Eccl. Hist., i. 13; ii. 1). At
all events we are sure that Christianity flourished in these
regions at a very early period; it is even possible that the
Syriac Scriptures were seen by Hegesippus in the second century
(Euseb., Eccl. Hist., iv. 22); they were familiarly used and
claimed as his national version by the eminent Ephraem of Edessa
in the fourth. Thus the universal belief of later ages, and the
very nature of the case, seem to render it unquestionable that the
Syrian Church was possessed of a translation, both of the Old and
New Testament, which it used habitually, and for public worship
exclusively, from the second century of our era downwards: as
early as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 170 ὁ Σύρος is cited by Melito on Gen. xxii. 13 (Mill,
Proleg. § 1239)<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>. And the sad history of that distracted Church
can leave no room to doubt what that version was. In the
middle of the fifth century, the third and fourth general Councils
at Ephesus and Chalcedon proved the immediate occasions of
dividing the Syrian Christians into three, and eventually into
yet more, hostile communions. These grievous divisions have
now subsisted for fourteen hundred years, and though the bitterness
of controversy has abated, the estrangement of the rival
Churches is as complete and hopeless as ever<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>. Yet the same
translation of Holy Scripture is read alike in the public assemblies
of the Nestorians among the fastnesses of Koordistan, of the
Monophysites who are scattered over the plains of Syria, of the
Christians of St. Thomas along the coast of Malabar, and of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Maronites on the mountain-terraces of Lebanon. Even though
these last acknowledged the supremacy of Rome in the twelfth
century, and certain Nestorians of Chaldaea in the eighteenth,
both societies claimed at the time, and enjoy to this day, the free
use of their Syriac translation of Holy Scripture. Manuscripts
too, obtained from each of these rival communions, have flowed
from time to time into the libraries of the West, yet they all
exhibit a text in every important respect the same; all are
without the Apocalypse and four of the Catholic Epistles, which
latter we know to have been wanting in the Syriac in the sixth
century (Cosmas Indicopleustes apud Montfaucon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Collectio
Nova Patrum et Script. Graec.,”</span> Tom. ii. p. 292), a defect, we may
observe in passing, which alone is no slight proof of the high
antiquity of the version that omits them; all correspond with
whatever we know from other sources of that translation which,
in contrast with one more recent, was termed <span class="tei tei-q">“old”</span> (ܩܕܡܑ or ܑܡܕܩ) by
Thomas of Harkel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616, and <span class="tei tei-q">“Peshitto”</span> (ܦܫܝܬܬܐ or ܐܬܬܝܫܦ) the <span class="tei tei-q">“Simple,”</span>
by the great Monophysite doctor, Gregory Bar-Hebraeus [1226-86].
Literary history can hardly afford a more powerful case
than has been established for the identity of the version of the
Syriac now called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peshitto</span></span> with that used by the Eastern
Church, long before the great schism had its beginning in the
native land of the blessed Gospel.

The first printed edition of this most venerable monument of
the Christian faith was published in quarto at Vienna in the
year 1555 (some copies are re-dated 1562), at the expense of the
Emperor Ferdinand I, on the recommendation and with the
active aid of his Chancellor, Albert Widmanstadt, an accomplished
person, whose travelling name in Italy was John Lucretius. It
was undertaken at the instance of Moses of Mardin, legate from
the Monophysite Patriarch Ignatius to Pope Julius III (1550-55),
who seems to have brought with him a manuscript, the text
whereof was of the Jacobite family, although written at Mosul,
for publication in the West. Widmanstadt contributed a second
manuscript of his own, though it does not appear whether
either or both contained the whole New Testament. This beautiful
book, the different portions of which have separate dedications,
was edited by Widmanstadt, by Moses, and by W. Postell
jointly, in an elegant type of the modern Syriac character, the
vowel and diacritic points, especially the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">linea occultans</span></span>, being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
frequently dropped, with subscriptions and titles indicating the
Jacobite Church Lessons in the older, or Estrangelo, letter. It
omits, as was natural and right, those books which the Peshitto
does not contain: viz. the second Epistle of Peter, the second
and third of John, that of Jude and the Apocalypse, together
with the disputed passage John vii. 53-viii. 11, and the doubtful,
or more than doubtful, clauses in Matt. xxvii. 35; Acts viii.
37; xv. 34; xxviii. 29; 1 John v. 7, 8. It omits Luke xxii. 17,
18, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a> on the passage. This <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">editio princeps</span></span> of the
Peshitto New Testament, though now become very scarce (one
half of its thousand copies having been sent into Syria), is held
in high and deserved repute, as its text is apparently based on
manuscript authority alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immanuel Tremellius [1510-80], a converted Jew (the proselyte,
first of Cardinal Pole, then of Peter Martyr), and Professor
of Divinity at Heidelberg, published the second edition in folio
in 1569, containing the New Testament in Hebrew type, with
a literal Latin version, accompanied by the Greek text and
Beza's translation of it, having a Chaldee and Syriac grammar
annexed. Tremellius used several manuscripts, especially one
at Heidelberg, and made from them and his own conjecture
many changes, that were not always improvements, in the text;
besides admitting some grammatical forms which are Chaldee
rather than Syriac. His Latin version has been used as their
basis by later editors, down to the time of Schaaf. Tremellius'
and Beza's Latin versions were reprinted together in London,
without their respective originals, in 1592. Subsequent editions
of the Peshitto New Testament were those of the folio Antwerp
or Royal Spanish Polyglott of Plantin (1571-73), in Hebrew and
Syriac type, revised from a copy written about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1200, which
Postell had brought from the East: two other editions of Plantin
in Hebrew type without points (1574, 8vo; 1575, 18mo), the
second containing various readings extracted by Francis
Rapheleng from a Cologne manuscript for his own reprints of
1575 and subsequently of 1583: the smaller Paris edition, also
in unpointed Hebrew letters, 1584, 4to, by Guy Le Fevre de la
Boderie, who prepared the Syriac portion of the Antwerp Polyglott
in 1571: that of Elias Hutter, in two folio volumes (Nuremberg,
1599-1600), in Hebrew characters; this editor venturing to
supply in Syriac of his own making the single passages wanting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">editio princeps</span></span> of Widmanstadt, and the spurious Epistle
to the Laodiceans. Martin Trost's edition (Anhalt-Cöthen, 1621,
4to), in Syriac characters, with vowel-points, a list of various
readings, and a Latin translation, is superior to Hutter's.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The magnificent Paris Polyglott (fol. 1645) is the first which
gives us the Old Testament portion of the Peshitto, though in an
incomplete state. The Maronite Gabriel Sionita, who superintended
this part of the Polyglott, made several changes in the
system of vowel punctuation, possibly from analogy rather than
from manuscript authority, but certainly for the better. He
inserted as integral portions of the Peshitto the version of the
four missing Catholic Epistles, which had been published in
1630 by our illustrious oriental scholar, Edward Pococke, from
a manuscript in the Bodleian (Orient. 119)<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>: and another of the
Apocalypse, edited at Leyden in 1627 by Louis De Dieu, from a
manuscript, since examined by Tregelles, in the University
Library there (Scaliger MS. 18), and from one sent him by Archbishop
Ussher, which is now in the Library of Trinity College,
Dublin (B. 5. 16). Of the two, the version of the Catholic
Epistles seems decidedly the older, and both bear much resemblance
to the later Syriac or Harkleian translation, but neither
have claim to be regarded as portions of the original Peshitto, to
which, however, they have been appended ever since.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bp. Walton's, or the London Polyglott (fol. 1654-7), affords
us little more than a reprint of Sionita's Syriac text, with Trost's
various readings appended, but interpolates the text yet further
by inserting John vii. 53-viii. 11. This passage, which is the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pericope de adultera,”</span> is found in Archbishop Ussher's copy,
dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1627, and made from a Maronite MS. of much esteem
at Kenobin under Mt. Lebanon; also in Brit. Mus. 14,470, in Cod.
Barsalibaei at New College, Oxford, and in the Paris Nat. Library
xxii, of which the two last copies are Harkleian, and the one in
the British Museum is Peshitto<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>. We are left to conjecture as to
the real date and origin of these translations, except that as far
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as the Harkleian is concerned, Dr. Gwynn has shown that
according to the Paris and Brit. Mus. MSS. they are claimed
for Paul, a contemporary of Thomas of Harkel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Giles Gutbier published at Hamburg (8vo, 1664) an edition
containing all the interpolated matter, and 1 John v. 7, 8 in
addition, from Tremellius' own version, which he inserted in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em>
margin. Gutbier used two manuscripts, by one of which, belonging
to Constantine L'Empereur, he corrected Sionita's system
of punctuation. A glossary, notes, and various readings are
annexed. The Sulzbach edition 12mo, 1684, seems a mere
reprint of Plantin's; nor does that published in Rome in 1713
for the use of the Maronites, though grounded upon manuscript
authority, appear to have much critical value.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A collation of the various readings in all the preceding
editions, excepting those of 1684 and 1713, is affixed to the
Syriac N. T. of J. Leusden and Ch. Schaaf (4to, Leyden, 1708-9:
with a new title-page 1717). It extends over one hundred
pages, and, though most of the changes noted are very insignificant,
is tolerably accurate and of considerable value. This
edition contains the Latin version of Tremellius not too
thoroughly revised, and is usually accompanied with an admirable
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lexicon Syriacum Concordantiale”</span> of the Peshitto New
Testament. Its worth, however, is considerably lessened by
a fancy of Leusden for pointing the vowels according to the
rules of Chaldee rather than of Syriac grammar: after his death,
indeed, and from Luke xviii. 27 onwards, this grave mistake
was corrected by Schaaf<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>. Of modern editions the most convenient,
or certainly the most accessible to English students, are
the N. T. which Professor Lee prepared in 1816 for the British
and Foreign Bible Society with the Eastern Church Lessons noted
in Syriac, and that of Wm. Greenfield [d. 1831], both in Bagster's
Polyglott of 1828, and in a small and separate form; the latter
editor aims at representing Widmanstadt's text distinct from the
subsequent additions derived from other sources. Lee's edition
was grounded on a collation of three fresh manuscripts, besides
the application of other matter previously available for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
revision of the text; but the materials on which he founded his
conclusions have never been printed, although their learned
collector once intended to do so, and many years afterwards
consented to lend them to Scrivener for that purpose; a promise
which his death in 1848 ultimately hindered him from redeeming.
An edition of the Gospels printed in 1829 by the British
and Foreign Bible Society for the Nestorian Christians was
based on a single manuscript brought from Mosul by Dr. Wolff.
Besides these, two editions have been published by the American
Bible Society, at Oroomia, Persia, in 1846, and at New York
(a reprint of the former) in 1878<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the foregoing statement it will plainly appear that no
edition of the Peshitto Syriac has yet been published with that
critical care on the part of editors which its antiquity and
importance so urgently demand. It is therefore a matter of
deep satisfaction that the work commenced by the late Philip
Pusey has been brought near conclusion by the Rev. G. H.
Gwilliam, for the University of Oxford. Mr. Gwilliam has
informed the editor that the Peshitto <span class="tei tei-q">“Tetraevangelium”</span> will be
the first part published, and will exhibit in its <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">apparatus criticus</span></span>

It is necessary to mention briefly this remarkable wealth of
evidence, probably to be largely increased by future investigations,
in which the Peshitto presents no inconsiderable parallel
to the vast amount of authorities on which the Greek Text of
the New Testament depends, because people are apt to underrate
the grand position of the Peshitto version, when comparing it
with the Curetonian Syriac, of which the sole evidence consists
only of two codices, if the newly-discovered one turns out to be
what was anticipated.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The volume which contained the greater part of the Curetonian
portions of the Gospels was brought by Archdeacon Tattam in
1842 from the Monastery of St. Mary Deipara in the Nitrian
Desert (p. 140). Eighty leaves and a half were picked out by
Dr. Cureton, then one of the officers in the Manuscript department
of the British Museum, from a mass of other matter
which had been bound up with them by unlearned possessors,
and comprise the Additional MS. 14,451 of the Library they
adorn, and two more reached England in 1847. They are in
quarto, with two columns on a page, in a bold hand and the
Estrangelo or old Syriac character, on vellum originally very
white, the single points for stops, some titles, &amp;c. being in red ink;
there are no marks of Church Lessons by the first hand, which
Cureton (a most competent judge) assigned to the middle of
the fifth century. The fragments contain Matt. i. 1-viii. 22;
x. 32-xxiii. 25; Mark xvi. 17-20; John i. 1-42; iii. 5-vii.
37; (but many words in iii. 6-iv. 6 are illegible); xiv. 10-12;
15-19; 21-23; 26-29; Luke ii. 48-iii. 16; vii. 33-xv. 21;
xvii. 23-xxiv. 44, or 1786 verses, so arranged that St. Mark's
Gospel is here immediately followed by St. John's. Three
more leaves of this version (part, perhaps, of the same MS.) were
found among the Syriac MSS. procured by Dr. Sachau, and
now at Berlin (Royal Libr. Orient. quart. 528). They contain
Luke xv. 22-xvi. 12; xvii. 1-23; John vii. 37-52; viii. 12-19.
They were published by Roediger (Monatsbericht, Berlin Royal
Academy of Sciences, July, 1872), and were privately printed by
the late Professor Wright to range with Cureton's volume.
Within the last year the discovery has been announced of
another Curetonian MS., which was found in the Library of the
Convent on Mount Sinai by Mrs. Lewis. An edition of it is now
in progress, but will not be published soon enough for notice in
this work. The Syriac text of the London MS. was printed in
fine Estrangelo type in 1848, and freely imparted to such scholars
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as might need its help; but it was not till 1858 that the work
was published<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>, with a very literal translation into rather
bald English, a beautiful and exact facsimile (Luke xv. 11-13;
16-19) by Mrs. Cureton, and a Preface (pp. xcv), full of
interesting and indeed startling matter. Dr. Cureton went so
far as to persuade himself that he had discovered in these Syriac
fragments a text of St. Matthew's Gospel that <span class="tei tei-q">“to a great extent,
has retained the identical terms and expressions which the
Apostle himself employed; and that we have here, in our Lord's
discourses, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to a great extent</span></em> the very same words as the Divine
Author of our holy religion Himself uttered in proclaiming the
glad tidings of salvation in the Hebrew dialect ...”</span> (p. xciii): that
here in fact we have to a great extent the original of that
Hebrew Gospel of St. Matthew of which the canonical Greek
Gospel is but a translation. It is beside our present purpose to
examine in detail the arguments of Dr. Cureton on this head<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>,
and it would be the less necessary in any case, since they seem
to have convinced no one save himself: but the place his version
occupies with reference to the Peshitto is a question upon which
there has been and still prevails a controversy which largely
concerns the issue between contending schools of textual
critics<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Any one who shall compare the verses we have cited from
them in parallel columns (pp. <a href="#Pg038" class="tei tei-ref">38-40</a>) will readily admit that the
translations have a common origin, whatever that may be; many
other passages, though not perhaps of equal length, might be named
where the resemblance is closer still; where for twenty words
together the Peshitto and the Curetonian shall be positively
identical, although the Syriac idiom would admit other words
and another order just as naturally as that actually employed.
Nor will this conclusion be shaken by the not less manifest fact
that throughout many passages the diversity is so great that no
one, with those places alone before him, would be led to suspect
any connexion between the two versions; for resemblances in
such a case furnish a positive proof, not to be weakened by the
mere negative presumption supplied by divergencies. Add to
this the consideration that the Greek manuscripts from which
either version was made or corrected (as the case may prove)
were materially different in their character; the Peshitto for the
most part favouring Cod. A<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>, the Curetonian taking part with
Cod. D, or with the Old Latin, or often standing quite alone,
unsupported by any critical authority whatever; and the reader
is then in possession of the whole case, from whose perplexities
we have to unravel our decision, which of these two recensions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
best exhibits the text of the Holy Gospels as received from the
second century downwards by the Syrian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must not dissemble the fact that Cureton's view of the
superior antiquity of the Curetonian to the Peshitto has been
adopted by many eminent scholars. So for example Dr. Hort,
who was obliged to account for the relation of the two by
a baseless supposition of an imaginary recension at Edessa or
Nisibis when the Peshitto was drawn up as a Syrian <span class="tei tei-q">“Vulgate”</span>
(The New Testament in Greek, pp. 135-7). So with more
strength of argument Dr. Nestle in <span class="tei tei-q">“Real Encyclopedie für
protestanche Theologie en Kirche<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Now it is obvious to remark, in the first place, that the
Peshitto has the advantage of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possession</span></em>, and that too of fourteen
centuries standing. The mere fact that the Syriac manuscripts
of the rival sects, whether modern or as old as the seventh
century, agree with each other in the most important points,
and at least to a large extent with the citations from Ephraem
and Aphraates, as will be shown, seems to bring the Peshitto
text, substantially in the same state as we have it at present, up
to the fourth century of our era. Of this version, again, there
are many codices, of different ages and widely diffused; of the
Curetonian there is indeed one, of the fifth century, so far as the
verdict of a most accomplished judge can determine so delicate
a question: yet surely this is not to be much preferred, in respect
to antiquity, to those ancient copies of the Peshitto which we
have enumerated on pp. <a href="#Pg010" class="tei tei-ref">10</a>, <a href="#Pg011" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>, and which include a MS. of the
fifth century, several others nearly as ancient, and two which
are dated in the sixth century, the Florentine of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 586, and
the Vatican of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 548. Another <span class="tei tei-q">“Curetonian”</span> MS., lately discovered,
is still under examination, and we have, as yet, no adequate
account of it. From the Peshitto, as the authorized version
of the Oriental Church, there are many quotations in Syriac books
from the fourth century downwards; Dr. Cureton, perhaps the
profoundest Syriac scholar of his day in England, failed to allege
any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> citation from the Gospels by a native writer which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
might serve to keep in countenance the statement of Dionysius
Barsalibi, late in the twelfth century, that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is found
occasionally a Syriac copy made out of the Hebrew, which
inserts the three kings in the genealogy”</span> (Matt. i. 8)<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>. With
every wish to give to this respectable old writer, and to others
who bear testimony to the same reading, the consideration that
is fairly their due, we can hardly fail to see that the weight of
evidence enormously preponderates in the opposite scale.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It will probably be admitted that in external proof Cureton's
theory is not strong, while yet the internal character of the version
may be deemed by many powerfully to favour his view.
Negligent or licentious renderings (and the Curetonian Syriac
is pretty full of them) cannot but lessen a version's usefulness
as an instrument of criticism, by increasing our difficulty of
reproducing the precise words of the original which the translator
had before him; but in another point of view these very
faults may still form the main strength of Dr. Cureton's case.
It is, no doubt, a grave suggestion, that the more polished,
accurate, faithful, and grammatical of the two versions—and the
Peshitto richly deserves all this praise—is more likely to have
been produced by a careful and gradual revision of one much its
inferior in these respects, than the worse to have originated in
the mere corruption of the better (Cureton, Pref. p. lxxxi).
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A priori</span></span>, we readily confess that probability inclines this way;
but it is a probability which needs the confirmation of facts, and
by adverse facts may be utterly set aside. Cureton's remark
that <span class="tei tei-q">“upon the comparison of several of the oldest copies now in
the British Museum of that very text of the Gospels which has
been generally received as the Peshitto, the more ancient the
manuscripts be, the more nearly do they correspond with the
text of these Syriac fragments”</span> (Pref. p. lxxiii), is confirmed by
other, and subsequent, labourers in the same field. The received
text of the Peshitto was printed from MSS. of a late type. It
was the opinion of P. E. Pusey (whose name has already been
mentioned in these pages) that a revision of the Peshitto text
was made in the eighth century. The oldest Syriac Massoretic
MS. which we possess is dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a. gr.</span></span> 1210 = <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 899<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>, but
a copy of the Gospels (Add. 14,448), the date of which appears to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a. h.</span></span> 80 = <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 699-700, contains a text which approximates
to the type of the printed Peshitto, but exhibits marginal notes
in a later hand, referring, however, chiefly to pronunciation and
accentuation. There is no evidence that any formal revision took
place; but it would appear certain that as questions of orthography,
of grammar, and of pronunciation were fixed by the decisions of
the Massoretes and grammarians, the faults (as they were deemed)
of the older readings were emended by scribes. Hence it is, that if
we open a codex of the Peshitto Gospels of about the date of the
Codex Curetonianus, we find many resemblances of the kind
indicated by Cureton, between the fifth century Peshitto text
and the Curetonian text, because both belong to an early, and
perhaps less accurate era of transcription<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>. But the resemblances
only extend to matters of grammar and spelling. In more
important readings, the fifth century form of the Peshitto does
not approximate to the Curetonian text. This was clearly seen
by Pusey, as a result of the collation of a large number of
Peshitto MSS. He found that the text of the oldest of them was
substantially the same as that which is printed in the Polyglotts.
The grammar may have been improved, but the translation was
not revised. This argument has been elaborated in two volumes
of the Oxford <span class="tei tei-q">“Studia Biblica,”</span> in part by the use of Philip
Pusey's materials, in part by independent researches. In vol. i,
paper viii, <span class="tei tei-q">“A Syriac Biblical MS. of the fifth century,”</span> the readings
which appear to be peculiar to that MS. (about seventy in
number, for it only contains SS. Matthew and Mark) are set out<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>.
Of these twenty-two can be compared with the Curetonian; and
it is found that only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> approximate more nearly than the
printed Peshitto to the text which, it is contended, is older than
the Peshitto. Further on<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> a stronger argument is adduced; for
it is shown that in eleven passages, where the fifth century codex
has a different reading from the printed Peshitto, the Curetonian,
instead of agreeing with the ancient text (as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex hypothesi</span></span> it
ought) approximates to the printed Peshitto, and sometimes
agrees with it. In vol. ii, paper iii, <span class="tei tei-q">“The materials for the
criticism of the Peshitto New Testament,”</span> other evidence is
adduced in support of the same conclusions. St. Matt. v. 31-48
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is given, with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">varr. lectt.</span></span> derived from twenty distinct authorities,
so as to place before the reader the Peshitto in its best and
most ancient form. The same passage is set out in the Curetonian
form. The various readings in the Peshitto in the
eighteen verses amount to at least thirty-one; but the majority
are the merest minutiae of spelling and pronunciation. Only one
deserves serious attention; and even that, more for accuracy than
in relation to the sense of the context; so little has the Syriac
New Testament been altered, or corrupted, in the course of ages
of transcription. Again, when comparison is made with the
Curetonian, while twenty-eight variations from the best form of
the Peshitto occur in the above passage, only four find any
support in an old Peshitto MS., and but one of the four is of any
interest. In addition to these there is one place where the
Curetonian agrees with the oldest Peshitto MSS., against the
printed Peshitto text. It is plain then that, as far as the
enquiry has yet been pursued, the peculiar readings of the
Curetonian cannot be traced backwards through the form of
text in the oldest Peshitto MSS. If such a revision of the
Peshitto, as Dr. Hort's theory postulates, ever took place, it
must have been made at a very remote period in the history
of Syriac Christian literature; and the new text must have been
substituted for the old by measures so drastic that the old (as far
as we know) survives only in one Nitrian and (as we are told) in
one Sinaitic MS. But this is not only improbable in itself,
but is contrary to the analogy supplied by the Latin versions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who contend for the superior antiquity of the Curetonian
rely in great part on the character of the quotations in
the two great Syriac writers, Aphraates and Mar-Ephraem, who
flourished in the century preceding the era in which our oldest
Peshitto MSS. were transcribed<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>. Both writers abound in
quotations from the New Testament, but many of them are very
free, or mere adaptations. A large number in St. Ephraem are
certainly from the Peshitto. Wright, in his edition of Aphraates,
was inclined to attribute that writer's quotations to the same
source. This has been traversed by others, who contend that
the quotations in Aphraates more nearly resemble the Curetonian,
or the text of Tatian's Diatessaron, as far as we know it.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The question of the source of St. Ephraem's quotations has been
fully discussed in <span class="tei tei-q">“Studia Biblica,”</span> iii, paper iv, by Rev. F. H.
Woods, who has also taken some notice of those in Aphraates.
Mr. Woods holds, as do others (though, as we think, on insufficient
evidence) that the text of the Peshitto was not fully settled
in the days of Aphraates and Ephraem. His conclusion is that
it is quite clear, that Ephraem, in the main, used the Peshitto
text (op. cit., p. 107), but as regards Aphraates, he holds that
the quotations approximate more closely to the Curetonian.
Yet Dr. Zahn, and many others, think that Aphraates used the
Diatessaron. The statement of these differences of opinion is
enough in itself to show that the source of quotations in these
ancient Syriac books is not always easy to determine. Hence it
follows that arguments based on the writings of Aphraates and
Ephraem are precarious. Moreover, a variation from the Peshitto
does not necessarily indicate the employment of another version.
The variation might be derived from a Greek text; for there
was constant intercourse between Greek and Syrian Christians,
and many of the latter were well acquainted with Greek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While we seek in vain amongst the readings of MSS., and the
writings of Syriac authors, for any satisfactory explanation of
the origin of the Curetonian, the work itself may perhaps reveal
something of its nature, if not of its history. We have already
seen<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> that in the opinion of certain textual critics the history
of the Latin Vulgate must have its counterpart in the history of
the Bible of Edessa. The origin of Jerome's translation is well
known. It is supposed that the Peshitto grew in like manner
out of an earlier translation. It is contended that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ur-Peshitto</span></span>
is represented to us by the text of the Curetonian; and
the two texts have been compared in order to establish this
relation. In so doing, no sufficient account has been taken of
the phenomena presented by the differences between the Peshitto
and the Curetonian. When it is argued that in some of those
differences the Peshitto text bears marks of emendation, of the
improving touch of a later hand, we answer<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>, that in others
there are as evident marks in the Curetonian of alteration and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
corruption. Indeed, to so large an extent do these prevail, that
there are good grounds for the suspicion which has been entertained
that the Curetonian (at least as exhibited by the editor
from his MS.) is itself the later version. In order to give
effect to this argument, it would be necessary to show the entire
extant Curetonian text, side by side with the corresponding
portions of the Peshitto; otherwise it is scarcely possible to
realize (i) how manifestly the Curetonian is an attempt to
improve upon the Peshitto text; and (ii) how frequently (as
a later composition) it demands an acquaintance with the
Gospels on the part of the reader; and (iii) how it is pervaded
by views of Gospel history, which belong to the Church rather
than to the sacred text. But even the short passages, which
we have printed as specimens, afford illustrations of the argument.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. In St. Matthew xii. 1-4, where the Peshitto exhibits the
Textus Receptus, saying that the disciples were hungry, and
began to pluck ears of corn and to eat, the Curetonian improves
upon the Peshitto thus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“and the disciples were hungry and
began to pluck ears of corn, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and break them in their hands</span></em>, and
eat”</span>—introducing words borrowed from St. Luke<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>.

2. (α) But in the next verse of the passage, where the words
<span class="tei tei-q">“on the sabbath”</span> are absolutely required in order to make the
Pharisees' question intelligible to the first readers of St. Matthew,
the Curetonian must needs draw on the common knowledge of
educated readers by exhibiting the question thus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Why are
thy disciples doing what is not lawful to do?”</span> Of course the
Peshitto is here an <span class="tei tei-q">“improvement”</span> on the Curetonian, in reading
the words <span class="tei tei-q">“on the Sabbath”</span>; but that does not affect our argument.
Would a primitive version, intended for first converts,
have left the reader ignorant what the action objected to might
be? whether to pluck ears in another man's field, or to rub out
grain on the Sabbath? But a later editor, who revised the text
for some purpose (it matters not, at present, for what purpose),
might consider the explanatory words superfluous.

Lord Jesus then, after He had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">commanded</span></em> His disciples, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was
exalted</span></em> to heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.”</span> The
simpler Peshitto phrase runs thus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus our Lord then, after
He had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spoken with them, ascended</span></em> to heaven, and sat on the
right hand of God.”</span> The two slight touches of improvement in
the Curetonian are evident, and belong to that aspect of the
record which finds expression in the Creeds, and in the obedience
of the Church. A similar touch appears in the Curetonian
addition to ver. 17—them that believe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on me</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again in Matt. v. 32 we read (with all authorities), <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever
shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication,”</span>
&amp;c.; so the Peshitto; but the Curetonian substitutes
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adultery</span></em>, and thereby sanctions, not the precept delivered by
our Lord, but the interpretation almost universally placed upon
it. Now either the Curetonian has alone preserved the true
text, or the Curetonian is an emended version. The first supposition
is unreasonable; the latter is alone suitable to this and
to many other passages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not less curious is the addition in ver. 41, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever shall
compel thee to go a mile, go with him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two others</span></em>.”</span> The Curetonian
(with D and some Latin copies) make our Lord say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> miles.”</span> If we cannot admit that this is the true text,
then it is an emendation; for it is no accidental change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is a distinct group of emendations which vividly
illustrates our contention, that the Curetonian form of Syriac
text is pervaded by views of Gospel history which belong rather
to the Church than to the sacred records. While fully accepting
the Catholic dogma of the perpetual virginity of the Blessed
Virgin, we must grant that it is in the nature of a pious opinion,
which Christian sentiment recognized as true, but which is not
explicitly stated in the New Testament. Hence we view with
grave suspicion a class of emendations which are obviously
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
framed to confute the heresy of the Helvidians. Such a class is
found in St. Matt. i. In ver. 16, Pesh., <span class="tei tei-q">“Joseph <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the husband of
Mary</span></em>;”</span> Cur., <span class="tei tei-q">“Joseph <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to whom was espoused Mary the Virgin</span></em>.”</span>
Ver. 19, Pesh., <span class="tei tei-q">“Joseph <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her husband</span></em>, being a just man;”</span> Cur.,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Joseph, because he was a righteous man.”</span> Ver. 20, Pesh., <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear
not to take unto thee Mary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thy wife</span></em>;”</span> Cur., <span class="tei tei-q">“Mary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thy espoused</span></em>.”</span>
Ver. 24, Pesh., <span class="tei tei-q">“Joseph ... took unto him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his wife</span></em>;”</span> Cur.,
<span class="tei tei-q">“took <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mary</span></em>.”</span> The Curetonian translator, for dogmatic purposes,
makes four distinct and separate omissions, in three of which he
stands unsupported—of the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">husband</span></span> in two places, of the
word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">wife</span></span> in two others. These are emendations of a deliberate
and peculiar kind. We cannot account for all these vagaries by
remarking that the Curetonian has often the support of the
so-called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Western</span></span> family of text<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>. We must face the question
whether the MS. of an ancient version, which exhibits such
singular phenomena on its first page, is worthy to be set above
that version, which is the common heritage of the whole Syriac
Church, and which appears to be the basis of the Curetonian
itself. To determine the place of a document in our Apparatus
Criticus, we must know something of its history. Of the history
of the Curetonian version we know nothing. Its internal character
inspires grave doubts of its trustworthiness. We note its
peculiarities with interest; but we do not yet see our way to
yield much deference to its authority. The Peshitto bears witness
to that form of text, which was received in very ancient
times in the Syriac Church. The Curetonian, like the Palestinian,
is interesting as showing what readings were accepted
locally, or by individual editors<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the history of the Harkleian Syriac version, which embraces
the whole New Testament except the Apocalypse, we possess
more exact information, though some points of difficulty may
still remain unsolved. Moses of Aghel in Mesopotamia, who
translated into Syriac certain works of the Alexandrian Cyril
about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 550, describes a version of the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Testament and
Psalter made in Syriac by Polycarp, Rural-Bishop<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> (rest his
soul!), for Xenaias of Mabug,”</span> &amp;c. This Xenaias or Philoxenus,
from whom the original translation takes its name, was Monophysite
Bishop of Mabug (Hierapolis) in Eastern Syria (488-518),
and doubtless wished to provide for his countrymen a more
literal translation from the Greek than the Peshitto aims at
being. His scheme may perhaps have been injudicious, but it
is a poor token of the presence of that quality which <span class="tei tei-q">“thinketh
no evil,”</span> to assert, without the slightest grounds for the suspicion,
<span class="tei tei-q">“More probable it is that his object was of a less commendable
character; and that he meant the version in some way to
subserve the advancement of his party<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>.”</span> Dr. Davidson will
have learnt by this time, that one may lie under the imputation
of heresy, without being of necessity a bigot or a dunce.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our next account of the work is even more definite. At the
end of the manuscripts of the Gospels from which the printed
text is derived, we read a subscription by the first hand, importing
that <span class="tei tei-q">“this book of the four holy Gospels was translated out
of the Greek into Syriac with great diligence and labour ... first
in the city of Mabug, in the year of Alexander of Macedon 819
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 508), in the days of the pious Mar Philoxenus, confessor,
Bishop of that city. Afterwards it was collated with much
diligence by me, the poor Thomas, by the help of two [<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or</span></em> three]
approved and accurate Greek Manuscripts in Antonia, of the
great city of Alexandria, in the holy monastery of the Antonians.
It was again written out and collated in the aforesaid place in the
year of the same Alexander 927 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616), Indiction iv. How
much toil I spent upon it and its companions the Lord alone
knoweth ... &amp;c.”</span> It is plain that by <span class="tei tei-q">“its companions”</span> the other
parts of the N. T. are meant, for a similar subscription (specifying
but one manuscript) is annexed to the Catholic Epistles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the labour of Thomas (surnamed from Harkel, his native
place, and like Philoxenus, subsequently Monophysite Bishop of
Mabug) was confined to the collation of the manuscripts he
names, and whose various readings, usually in Greek characters,
with occasional exegetical notes, stand in the margin of all
copies but one at Florence, is not a probable opinion. It is
likely that he added the asterisks and obeli which abound in
the version<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> and G. H. Bernstein (De Charklensi N. T. transl.
Syriac. Commentatio, Breslau, 1837) believes that he so modified
the text itself, that it remains in the state in which Polycarp left
it only in one codex now at Rome, which he collated for a few
chapters of St. John.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have been reminded by Tregelles, who was always ready
to give every one his due, that our own Pococke in 1630, in the
Preface to his edition of the Catholic Epistles not included in
the Peshitto, both quotes an extract from Dionysius Barsalibi,
Bishop of Amida (Diarbekr), who flourished in the twelfth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
century, which mentions this version, and even shows some
acquaintance with its peculiar character. Although again
brought to notice in the comprehensive <span class="tei tei-q">“Bibliotheca Orientalis”</span>
(1719-28) of the elder J. S. Assemani [1687-1768], the Harkleian
attracted no attention until 1730, in which year Samuel Palmer
sent from Diarbekr to Dr. Gloucester Ridley four Syriac manuscripts,
two of which proved to belong to this translation, both
containing the Gospels, one of them being the only extant copy
of the Acts and all the Epistles. Fortunately Ridley [1702-1774]
was a man of some learning and acuteness, or these precious
codices might have lain disregarded as other copies of the
same version had long done in Italy; so that though he did not
choose to incur the risk of publishing them in full, he communicated
his discovery to Wetstein, who came to England once
more, in 1746, for the purpose of collating them for his edition of
the N. T., then soon to appear: he could spare, however, but
fourteen days for the task, which was far too short a time, the
rather as the Estrangelo character, in which the manuscripts
were written, was new to him. In 1761 Ridley produced his
very careful and valuable tract, De Syriacarum N. F. Versionum
Indole atque Usu Dissertatio, and on his death his manuscripts
went to New College, of which society he had been a Fellow.
The care of publishing them was then undertaken by the
Delegates of the Oxford Press, who selected for their editor
Joseph White [1746-1814], then Fellow of Wadham College and
Professor of Arabic, afterwards Canon of Christ Church; who,
though now, I fear, chiefly remembered for the most foolish
action of his life, was an industrious, able, and genuine scholar.
Under his care the Gospels appeared in two vols. 4to, 1778<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a Latin version and satisfactory Prolegomena; the Acts and
Catholic Epp. in 1799, the Pauline in 1803. Meanwhile Storr
(Observat. super N. T. vers. Syr., 1772) and Adler (N. T. Version.
Syr., 1789) had examined and described seven or eight continental
codices of the Gospels in this version, some of which
are thought superior to White's<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The characteristic feature of the Harkleian is its excessive
closeness to the original: it is probably the most servile version
of Scripture ever made. Specimens of it will appear on pp. <a href="#Pg038" class="tei tei-ref">38-40</a>,
by the side of those from other translations, which will
abundantly justify this statement. The Peshitto is beyond
doubt taken as its basis, and is violently changed in order to
force it into rigorous conformity with the very letter of the
Greek. In the twenty verses of Matt. xxviii we note seventy-six
such alterations: three of them seem to concern various readings
(vers. 2-18; and 5 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">marg.</span></span>); six are inversions in the order; about
five are substitutions of words for others that may have grown
obsolete: the rest are of the most frivolous description, the
definite state of nouns being placed for the absolute, or vice
versa; the Greek article represented by the Syriac pronoun; the
inseparable pronominal affixes (that delicate peculiarity of the
Aramaean dialects) retrenched or discarded; the most unmeaning
changes made in the tenses of verbs, and the lesser particles. Its
very defects, however, as being servilely accurate, give it weight
as a textual authority: there can be no hesitation about the
readings of the copies from which such a book was made. While
those employed for the version itself in the sixth century
resembled more nearly our modern printed editions, the three or
more codices used by Thomas at Alexandria must have been
nearly akin to Cod. D (especially in the Acts), and, next to D,
support BL, 1, 33, 69. <span class="tei tei-q">“Taken altogether,”</span> is Dr. Hort's comment,
<span class="tei tei-q">“this is one of the most confused texts preserved: but it may be
rendered more intelligible by fresh collations and better editing,
even if they should fail to distinguish the work of Thomas of
Harkel from that of his predecessor Polycarpus”</span> (Introd.,
p. 156).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The number of MSS. of this Harkleian version is far greater
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than it was supposed to have been. The important discovery of
the Mohl MS., now in the possession of the Cambridge University

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are extant several scattered fragments of the Old and
New Testaments, in a form of Syriac entirely distinct from the
versions already described. These fragments are all in one
dialect, and are apparently parts of a single version. The most
considerable portion is an Evangelistarium which was discovered
virtually by Adler, who collated, described, and copied a portion
of it (Matt. xxvii. 3-32) for that great work in a small compass,
his <span class="tei tei-q">“N. T. Versiones Syriacae”</span> (1789): S. E. Assemani the nephew
had merely inserted it in his Vatican Catalogue (1756). It is
a partial Lectionary of the Gospels in the Vatican (MS. Syr. 19),
on 196 quarto thick vellum leaves, written in two columns in
a rude hand, the rubric notes of Church Lessons in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carshunic</span></span>,
i.e. Arabic in Syriac letters, with many mistakes. From a subscription,
we learn that the scribe was Elias, a presbyter of Abydos,
who wrote it in the Monastery of the Abbat Moses at Antioch, in
the year of Alexander 1341, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1030. Adler gives a poor
facsimile (Matt. xxvii. 12-22): the character is peculiar, and all
diacritic points (even that distinguishing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dolath</span></span> from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rish</span></span>), as
well as many other changes, are thought to be by a later hand.
Tregelles confirms Assemani's statement, which Adler had disputed,
that the first six leaves, showing traces of Greek writing
buried beneath the Syriac, proceeded from another scribe. The
remarkable point, however, about this version (which seems to
be made from the Greek, and is quite independent of the Peshitto)
is the peculiar dialect it exhibits, and which has suggested its
name. Its grammatical forms are far less Syriac than Chaldee,
which latter it resembles even in that characteristic particular,
the prefixing of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">yud</span></span>, not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nun</span></span>, to the third person masculine of
the future of verbs<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>; and many of the words it employs can be
illustrated only from the Chaldee portions of the Old Testament, or
from the Jerusalem, or Palestinian, Targum and Talmud<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>. Adler's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account of the translation and its copyist is not very flattering,
<span class="tei tei-q">“satis constat dialectum esse incultam et inconcinnam ... orthographiam
autem vagam, inconstantem, arbitrariam, et ab imperito
librario rescribendo et corrigendo denuo impeditam”</span> (Vers. Syr.,
p. 149). As it is mentioned by no Syriac writer, it was probably
used but in a few remote churches of Lebanon or Galilee: but
though (to employ the words of Porter) <span class="tei tei-q">“in elegance far surpassed
by the Peshitto; in closeness of adherence to the original by the
Philoxenian”</span> (Principles of Textual Criticism, Belfast, 1848,
p. 356); it has its value, and that not inconsiderable, as a witness
to the state of the text at the time it was turned into Syriac;
whether, with Adler, we regard it as derived from a complete
version of the Gospels made not later than the sixth century, or
with Tischendorf refer it to the fifth<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>. Tregelles (who examined
the codex at Rome) wrongly judged it a mere translation of some
Greek Evangelistarium of a more recent date. Of all the
Syriac books, this copy and Barsalibi's recension of the Harkleian
alone contain John vii. 53-viii. 11; the Lectionary giving
it as the Proper Lesson for Oct. 8, St. Pelagia's day. In general
its readings much resemble those of Codd. BD, siding with B
eighty-five times, with D seventy-nine, in the portions published
by Adler; but with D <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> eleven times, with B alone but three.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The information afforded by Adler respecting this remarkable
document gave rise to a natural wish that the whole manuscript
should be carefully edited by some respectable scholar. This
has now been done by Count Francis Miniscalchi Erizzo, who
in 1861-4 published at Verona in two quarto volumes <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangeliarium
Hierosolymitanum ex Codice Vaticano Palaestino
deprompsit, edidit, Latinè vertit, Prolegomenis ac Glossario
adornavit Comes F. M. E.”</span> This elaborate work, for such it is,
although its execution fails on the whole to satisfy critics of
the calibre of Land and the Abbé Martin, ends with a list of
those chapters and verses of the Gospels (according to the
notation of the Latin Vulgate), which the manuscript contains
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in full. Tischendorf, in the eighth edition of his Greek Testament,
enriched his notes with the various readings these Church
Lessons exhibit; their critical character being much the same as
Adler's slight specimen had given us reason to expect<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>. The
Lectionary closely resembles that of the Greek Church, the
slight differences in the beginnings and endings of the Lessons
scarcely exceeding those subsisting between different Greek
copies, as noticed in our Synaxarion. It contains the Sunday
and week-day Gospels for the first eight weeks beginning at
Easter (with a few verses lost in two places of Week <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">viii</span></span>); the
Saturday and Sunday Gospels only for the rest of the year;
the Lessons for the Holy Week, complete as detailed in Vol. I. 85,
with two or three slight exceptions; and the eleven Gospels
of the Resurrection. In the Menology or Calendar of Immoveable
Feasts, there is a greater amount of variation in regard
to the Saints' Days kept, as indeed we might have looked
for beforehand. We subjoin a list of those whose Gospels are
given at length in the manuscript, together with the portions of
Scripture appointed for each day, in order that this curious
Syriac service-book may be compared with that of the Greeks.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Assemani (Biblioth. Orient., tom. ii. p. 283), on the authority
of Gregory Bar-Hebraeus, mentions what has been supposed
to have been a Syriac <span class="tei tei-q">“version”</span> of the N. T., other than the
Peshitto and Harkleian, which was named <span class="tei tei-q">“Karkaphensian”</span>
(ܩܪܩܦܢܬܐ or ܐܬܢܦܩܪܩ), whether, as he thought, because it was used by
Syrians of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mountains</span></span>, or from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carcuf</span></span>, a city of Mesopotamia.
Adler (Vers. Syr., p. 33) was inclined to believe that
Bar-Hebraeus meant rather a revised manuscript than a
separate translation. Cardinal Wiseman, in the course of
those youthful studies which gave such seemly, precocious,
deceitful promise (Horae Syriacae, Rom. 1828), discovered in the
Vatican (MS. Syr. 152) a Syriac manuscript of readings from
both Testaments, with the several portions of the New standing
in the following order; Acts, James, 1 Peter, 1 John, the fourteen
Epistles of St. Paul, and then the Gospels, these being the
only books contained in the true Peshitto. In the margin
also are placed by the first hand many readings indicated by
the abbreviation ܛܘ (or ܘܛ) [with a line over the last letter],
the title of some scribe or teacher<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>. The
codex is on thick yellow vellum, in large folio, with the two
columns so usual in Syriac writing; the ink, especially the points
in vermilion, has often grown pale, and it has been carefully
retouched by a later hand; the original document being all the
work of one scribe: some of the marginal notes refer to various
readings. There are several long and tedious subscriptions in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the volume, whereof one states that the copy was written <span class="tei tei-q">“in
the year of the Greeks 1291 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 980) in the [Monophysite]
monastery of Aaron on [mount] Sigara, in the jurisdiction of
Calisura, in the days of the Patriarchs John and Menna, by
David a deacon of Urin in the jurisdiction of Gera”</span> [Γέρρα, near
Beroea or Aleppo]. It may be remarked that Assemani has
inserted a letter in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Bibliotheca Orientalis”</span> from John the
Monophysite Patriarch [of Antioch] to his brother Patriarch,
Menna of Alexandria. This manuscript, of which Wiseman gives
a rather rude facsimile, is deemed by him of great importance
in tracing the history of the Syriac vowel-points. Other Karkaphensian
manuscripts have been examined since Wiseman's time;
and all, whether containing more, or less, of the actual text,
agree in the parts which are common, with, however, some
independent readings. We subjoin Matt. i. 19 in four texts,
wherein the close connexion of the Karkaphensian and the
Nestorian recension with the Peshitto is very manifest.

The reader must not be misled by this specimen to infer that
the Karkaphensian always coincides with the Peshitto. It is
not a continuous text, but only those verses or passages are

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the results of a wider examination of Syriac MSS. in
different Libraries have been made more generally known by
Mr. Gwilliam's Essay in the third volume of <span class="tei tei-q">“Studia Biblica<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>.”</span>
According to the investigations of the leading Syriac scholars, it
appears that the Karkaphensian is not a distinct version, but
a kind of Massorah—the attempt to preserve the best traditions
of the orthography and pronunciation of the more important or
difficult words of the Syriac Vernacular Bible. This Massoretic
teaching differs from the Hebrew Massorah, in that whilst the
latter supplies us with all that we know of the form of the
Jewish Scriptures<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>, the Syriac Massorah is younger than our

Matt. xxvii. 33, and the parallel passages, as a translation
of κρανίου. It is known that grammatical and philological
studies were pursued by Jacob of Edessa (d. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 710), probably
by Joseph Huzita, rector of the school at Nisibis (vi); and a tract

We have now traced the history of the several Syriac versions,
so far at least as to afford the reader some general idea of
their relative importance as materials for the correction of the
sacred text. We will next give parallel renderings of Matt. xii.
1-4; Mark xvi. 17-20 from the Peshitto, the Curetonian, and
the Harkleian, the only versions known in full; for Matt.
xxvii. 3-8, in the room of the Curetonian, which is here lost,
we have substituted the Jerusalem Syriac, and have retained
throughout Thomas' marginal notes to the Harkleian, its
asterisks and obeli. We have been compelled to employ the
common Syriac type, though every manuscript of respectable
antiquity is written in the Estrangelo character. Even from
these slight specimens the servile strictness of the Harkleian,
and some leading characteristics of the other versions, will
readily be apprehended by an attentive student (e.g. of the Curetonian
in Matt. xii. 1; 4; Mark xvi. 18; 20).

We hoped to include in this account some description of the
MS. lately discovered by Mrs. Lewis in the Monastery of
St. Catherine, at Mount Sinai, and brought in copy last spring to
Cambridge. It is now undergoing the careful and skilful
examination which the character of the accomplished assistants
of Mrs. Lewis ensures, and it is impossible at present to
anticipate the verdict upon it which those scholars may recommend,
and which may be finally adopted by the learned world
at large. The photographic illustration of a page, which has
been made public<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>, does not suggest that the MS. possesses any
very remarkable antiquity. But it is due to our argument
upon the mutual relations of the Peshitto and the Curetonian to
remark, that the Curetonian will even then rest upon only two
MSS., one of them being a palimpsest, in face of the numerous
supports of the Peshitto, and that even if the Curetonian be
proved, as seems improbable, to date from somewhat further
back than we have supposed, the claim of the Peshitto to production
in the early part of the second century, and to a superior
antiquity, will not thereby be removed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the publication of the third edition of this book, exhaustive
work on the Old Latin Versions and the Vulgate,
commenced before for the University of Oxford, as is well
known amongst biblical scholars, by the Right Rev. John
Wordsworth, D.D., Bishop of Salisbury, with the assistance of
the Rev. H. J. White, has been prosecuted further, resulting
in the publication of three volumes of Old Latin Biblical
Texts, and of the edition of the Vulgate New Testament as far
as the end of St. Luke's Gospel. It was therefore with the liveliest
gratitude that the Editor received from the Bishop, in reply
to consultation upon a special point, an offer to superintend
the entire revision of this chapter, if Mr. White would give him
his important help, notwithstanding other laborious occupations.
Mr. White has carried out the work under the Bishop's direction,
rewriting most of the chapter entirely, but incorporating, where
possible, Dr. Scrivener's language.

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">(1) The Old Latin, previous to Jerome's Revision.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are passages in the works of the two great Western
Fathers of the fourth century, Jerome [345?-420] and Augustine
[354-430], whose obvious and literal meaning might lead us to
conclude that there existed in their time <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many</span></em> Latin translations,
quite independent in their origin, and used almost indifferently
by the faithful. When Jerome, in that Preface to the Gospels
which he addressed to Pope Damasus (in 384), anticipates but
too surely the unpopularity of his revision of them among the
people of his own generation, he consoles himself by the reflection
that the variations of previous versions prove the unfaithfulness
of them all: <span class="tei tei-q">“verum non esse quod variat etiam maledicorum
testimonio comprobatur.”</span> Then follows his celebrated assertion:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Si enim Latinis exemplaribus fides est adhibenda, respondeant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quibus: tot enim sunt exemplaria pene quot codices<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>.”</span> The
testimony of Augustine seems even more explicit, and at first
sight conclusive. In his treatise, De Doctrina Christiana (lib. ii.
cc. 11-15), when speaking of <span class="tei tei-q">“Latinorum interpretum infinita
varietas,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“interpretum numerositas,”</span> as not without their
benefit to an attentive reader, he uses these strong expressions:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Qui enim Scripturas ex hebraea lingua in Graecam verterunt,
numerari possunt, Latini autem interpretes nullo modo. Ut
enim cuique primis fidei temporibus in manus venit codex
Graecus, et aliquantulum facultatis sibi utriusque linguae habere
videbatur, ausus est interpretari”</span> (c. 11); and he soon after
specifies a particular version as preferable to the rest: <span class="tei tei-q">“In ipsis
autem interpretationibus Itala<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> ceteris praeferatur. Nam est
verborum tenacior cum perspicuitate sententiae”</span> (cc. 14-15).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When, however, the surviving codices of the version or versions
previous to Jerome's revision came to be studied and published
by Sabatier<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> and Bianchini<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>, it was obvious that though there
were many points of difference, there were still traces of
a source common to many, if not to all of them; and on
a question of this kind, occasional divergency, however extensive,
cannot weaken the impression produced by resemblance, if it be
too close and constant to be attributable to chance, as we have
just seen. The result of a careful and thorough examination and
comparison of the existing Old Latin texts, is a conviction that
they are all but off-shoots from one, or at most two, parent stocks.
Now when, this fact fairly established, we look back at the
language employed by Jerome and Augustine, we can easily see
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that, with some allowance for his habit of rhetorical exaggeration,
the former may mean no more by the term <span class="tei tei-q">“exemplaria”</span> than
that the scattered copies of the Latin translation in his own day
varied widely from each other; and though the assertions of
Augustine are too positive to be thus disposed of, yet he is here
speaking, not from his own personal knowledge so much as from
vague conjecture; and of what had been done, not in his own
time, but <span class="tei tei-q">“in the first ages of the faith.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On one point, however, Augustine must be received as a competent
and most sufficient witness. We cannot hesitate to believe
that one of the several recensions current towards the end of the
fourth century was distinguished from the rest by the name of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Itala</span></span><a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>, and in his judgement deserved praise for its clearness and
fidelity. It was long regarded as certain that here we should
find the Old Latin version in its purest form, and that in Italy it
had been thus used from the very beginning of the Church, <span class="tei tei-q">“cum
Ecclesia Latina sine versione Latina esse non potuerit”</span> (Walton,
Proleg. x. 1). Mill indeed reminds us that the early Church at
Rome was composed to so great an extent of Jewish and other
foreigners, whose vernacular tongue was Greek, that the need of
a Latin translation of Scripture would not at first be felt; yet
even he would not place its date later than Pius I (142-157), the
first Bishop of Rome after Clement who bears a Latin name
(Mill, Proleg. § 377). It was not until attention had been specially
drawn to the style of the Old Latin version, that scholars began
to suggest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Africa</span></span> as the place, and the second half of the second
century as the time, of its origin. This opinion, which had
obtained favour with Eichhorn and some others before him, may
be considered as demonstrated by Cardinal Wiseman, in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Two letters on some parts of the controversy concerning
1 John v. 7<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>.”</span> So far as his argument rests on the Greek
character of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></em> Church, it may not bring conviction
to the reflecting reader. Even though the early Bishops of
Rome were of foreign origin, though Clement towards the end of
the first, Gaius the presbyter late in the second century, who are
proved by their names to be Latins, yet chose to write in Greek;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it does not follow that the Church would not contain many
humbler members, both Romans and Italians, ignorant of any
language except Latin, and for whose instruction a Latin version
would be required. On the ground of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> evidence, however,
Wiseman made out a case which all who have followed him,
Lachmann, Tischendorf, Davidson, Tregelles, accept as irresistible;
indeed it is not easy to draw any other conclusion from his
elaborate comparison of the words, the phrases, and grammatical
constructions of the Latin version of Holy Scripture, with the
parallel instances by which they can be illustrated from African
writers, and from them only (Essays, vol. i. pp. 46-66)<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>. It is
impossible to exhibit any adequate abridgement of an investigation
which owes all its cogency to the number and variety of
minute particulars, each one weak enough by itself, the whole
comprising a mass of evidence which cannot be gainsaid. In
the works of Apuleius and of the African Fathers, Tertullian
[150?-220?], Cyprian [† 258], and in the following century,
Arnobius, Lactantius, Augustine, we obtain a glimpse into the
genius and character of the dialect in which the earliest form of
the Old Latin version is composed. We see a multitude of words
which occur in no Italian author so late as Cicero; constructions
(e.g. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dominantur eorum</span></span>, Luke xxii. 25; <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">faciam vos fieri</span></span>, Matt.
iv. 19) or forms of verbs (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sive consolamur ... sive exhortamur</span></span>,
2 Cor. i. 6) abound<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>, which at Rome had long been obsolete;
while the lack of classic polish is not ill-atoned for by a certain
vigour which characterizes this whole class of writers, but never
degenerates into barbarism.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">European</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></em> forms of the Old Latin version
will be discussed afterwards.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following manuscripts of the version are extant. They

are usually cited by the small italic letters of the alphabet,

Bentley's coadjutor in his great but unfinished work for the New

published St. Matthew's Gospel with full Introductions in 1883 (Old

how far it is a mere reproduction of the Greek, or whether the Greek has

to Prof. J. Rendel Harris' work, The Codex Sangallensis (Cambridge,

To these thirty-eight codices must be added extracts from
the Latin Fathers, of which the Latin interpreter of Irenaeus,
Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Priscillian, and Primasius are
the most important for the history of the version. For Tertullian,
considerable labour will be saved to the student by the work of
H. Roensch (Das neue Testament Tertullians, Leipzig, 1871), who
has arranged in order his quotations, direct and indirect; for
Cyprian, Hartel's excellent edition (vol. iii in the Vienna Corpus)
is marred by his having edited the Testimonia, which consist of
direct quotations from the Bible, arranged under various heads,
from a late and inferior MS. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> O. L. Bibl. Texts, ii. p. xliii).
The works of Priscillian, who suffered death as a heretic in 385,
have been quite lately discovered and edited by Dr. G. Schepss
(vol. xviii in the Vienna Corpus); the quotations in them bear
a strong resemblance to those of the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Speculum”</span> of
St. Augustine (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>), and are mainly from the Epistles. Primasius,
bishop of Hadrumetum (d. 558?), was the author <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span></span> of
a commentary on the Apocalypse; in this he incorporated nearly
the entire text of that book, and as this text agrees almost word
for word with the citations found in Cyprian's Testimonia, we
thus obtain a complete African text of a book in which so many
MSS. are defective. In addition to this he quoted largely from
another Latin translation of the Apocalypse—that of the Donatist
Ticonius—whose version seems to be a good specimen of a later
text approximating more closely to the Vulgate; these have also
been published quite recently by Professor Haussleiter (Zahn's
Forschungen, iv. Teil, Leipzig, 1891).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we come to arrange these authorities for the Latin
version before Jerome, we find a complicated and difficult task
before us; for few of our MSS. present a consistent type of text.
We will confine ourselves therefore to grouping them in the three
great families described by Dr. Hort (Introd. p. 78), whose division
has been accepted by most textual critics, and to pointing out
how here and there even that division must be accepted with
some modification.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">African</span></em> family is comparatively easy to fix, from the
rich store of biblical quotations found in the African Fathers.
Tertullian indeed does not give us so much help as we should
have expected, as he seems to have largely used a Greek Bible
and translated it into Latin himself. Cyprian's quotations,
however, are valuable, as he apparently confined himself strictly
to the Latin Bible current in his time; he may be taken as the
standard of the early African version; to him we must add, for
the Gospels, the Bobbio MS. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>) and the Codex Palatinus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>), which,
however, represents a stage somewhat later than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>; for the Acts,
the Fleury palimpsest (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span>); for the Apocalypse, Primasius and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span>;
and a later and revised stage in the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Speculum”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>), and
in the quotations from Ticonius preserved in Primasius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Existing simultaneously with the African family we find
another type of text current in Western Europe, though whether
it is a revision of the African text or is of independent origin,
it is hard to say. This type Dr. Hort calls the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">European</span></span>. It is
represented in the Gospels by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>, which may be taken as the
typical European MS.; by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> in St. Matthew, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span> (Luke and Mark),
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">2</span></span> (giving us fragments of all the Gospels from the same
MS.); <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></span> in St. Mark; in a slightly revised form by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span> of St. Matthew;
in a form marked by special local characteristics, in the Irish
MSS. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">1</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">p</span></span> (St. John); to a certain extent also by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">q</span></span> (i.e. in
its renderings, and turns of expression, as distinct from the type
of Greek text underlying it); of the early Fathers, the Latin
version of Irenaeus may probably be referred to this family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the European text in the Acts, Dr. Hort cites the Gigas
Holmiensis (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>), and the Milan Lectionary <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">2</span></span>, and the Bobbio
fragments at Vienna (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>); for the Epistles, the Corbey MS. of
St. James (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span>), though this has possibly a tinge of Africanism in
it (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Bp. Wordsworth and Dr. Sanday in <span class="tei tei-q">“Studia Biblica,”</span> i.
pp. 113, 233); and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span> again for the Apocalypse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></em> family presents us with a type of text mainly
European, but doubly revised; first in its renderings, <span class="tei tei-q">“to give the
Latinity a smoother and more customary aspect,”</span> and secondly
in its underlying text, which has been largely corrected from the
Greek; in both these points the Italian MSS. are a sort of stepping-stone
between the European MSS. and Jerome's Vulgate; and
as many of the Biblical quotations in Augustine's works agree
closely with them, it is distinctly probable that it was this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
revision which he praised as the Itala. To this group we would
assign <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span> in the Gospels, and less notably <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">q</span></span>; in the Epistles the
Freisingen fragments <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">q</span></span> of St. John and St. Peter, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">2</span></span> of
St. Paul's Epistles, and the Göttweig fragments <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">3</span></span> of Romans
and Galatians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it will be seen that this arrangement leaves a large
number of MSS. unaccounted for; many of the Old Latin MSS.
present texts which it is impossible to class either as African,
European, or Italian. Some of them possess all three characteristics;
some have been half corrected from the Vulgate; and
local variation, independent translation from the Greek, and
in the case of the Graeco-Latin MSS., assimilation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to</span></em> the Greek,
have still further complicated matters. Among these mixed texts
must be placed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> in SS. Mark, Luke, and John (with occasional
Africanisms, and a large element quite peculiar to itself); <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>,
which gives us a text very near the Vulgate in St. John;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>, that apparently insoluble problem; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">1</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">2</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">1</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>δ; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span>, a text
which to a large extent is almost pure Vulgate, but which at the
same time preserves a number of readings, mostly interpolations,
that are quite peculiar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must bear in mind too that even the MSS. which seem to
represent most consistently one type of text, show here and there
strange vacillations; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>, African throughout as it seems at first
sight, must have been copied from an ordinary European MS. in
the last few chapters of St. Luke; the parent MS. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span> obviously
did not contain the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pericope de adultera</span></span>, for that passage has
been supplied in a Vulgate text; and other instances might be
added.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The extensive variations then existing between different copies
of the Old Latin version, and the obvious corruptions which had
crept into some of them, prompted Damasus, Bishop of Rome, in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 382, to commit the important task of a formal revision of
the New, and probably of the Old Testament, to Jerome, a
presbyter born at Stridon on the confines of Dalmatia and
Pannonia, probably a little earlier than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 345. He had just
returned to Rome, where he had been educated, from his hermitage
in Bethlehem, and in the early ripeness of his scholarship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
undertook a work for which he was specially qualified, and whose
delicate nature he well understood<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>. Whatever prudence and
moderation could do in this case to remove objections or relieve
the scruples of the simple, were not neglected by Jerome, who
not only made as few changes as possible in the Old Latin when
correcting its text by the help of <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient”</span> Greek manuscripts<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>,
but left untouched many words and forms of expression, and not
a few grammatical irregularities, which in a new translation (as
his own subsequent version of the Hebrew Scriptures makes
clear) he would most certainly have avoided. The four Gospels,
as they stand in the traditional Greek order without Western
variation, revised but not re-translated on this wise principle,
appeared in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 384, accompanied with his celebrated Preface to
Damasus (<span class="tei tei-q">“summus sacerdos”</span>), who died that same year. Notwithstanding
his other literary engagements, it is probable
enough that his recension of the whole New Testament for
public use was completed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 385, though the proof alleged by
Mill (N. T., Proleg., § 862), and by others after his example, hardly
meets the case. In the next year (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 386), in his Commentary
on Galat., Ephes., Titus, and Philem., he indulges in more freedom
of alteration as a translator than he had previously deemed
advisable; while his new version of the Old Testament from the
Hebrew (completed about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 405) is not founded at all on the
Old Latin, which was made from the Greek Septuagint; the
Psalter excepted, which he executed at Rome at the same date,
and in the same spirit, as the Gospels. The boldness of his
attempt in regard to the Old Testament is that portion of his
labours which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> Augustine disapproved<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> (August, ad
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hieron. Ep. x. tom. ii. p. 18, Lugd. 1586, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 403), and indeed
it was never received entire by the Western Church, which long
preferred his slight revision of the Old Latin, made at some
earlier period of his life. Gradually, however, Jerome's recension
of the whole Bible gained ground, as well through the growing
influence of the Church of Rome as from its own intrinsic merits:
so that when in course of time it came to take the place of the
older version, it also took its name of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vulgate</span></span>, or common
translation<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>. Cassiodorus indeed, in the middle of the sixth
century, is said to have compared the new and old Latin (of the
New, perhaps of both Testaments) in parallel columns, which
thus became partially mixed in not a few codices: but Gregory
the Great (590-604), while confessing that his Church used both
<span class="tei tei-q">“quia sedes Apostolica, cui auctore Deo praesideo, utrâque utitur,”</span>
(Epist. Dedic. ad Leandrum, c. 5), awarded so decided a preference
to Jerome's translation from the Hebrew, that this form of his
Old Testament version, not without some mixture with his
translation from the Septuagint (Walton, Polyglott, Prol. x.
pp. 242-244, Wrangham), and his Psalter and New Testament
as revised from the Old Latin, came at length to comprise the
Vulgate Bible, the only shape in which Holy Scripture was
accessible in Western Europe (except to a few scattered scholars)
during the long night of the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it was not a pure Vulgate text that was thus used; the
old versions went on side by side with it for centuries, and even
when they were thus nominally superseded, fragments of them
found their way into probably all existing MSS. We have
already remarked (in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span> &amp;c.) how the same MS. will present
us with an Old Latin text in some books of the New Testament,
and with a Vulgate text in others; we shall note the same
phenomenon in other MSS., especially the British and Irish (see
the MSS. numbered <a href="#Vulgate_51" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>, <a href="#Vulgate_67" class="tei tei-ref">67</a>, <a href="#Vulgate_78" class="tei tei-ref">78</a>, <a href="#Vulgate_85" class="tei tei-ref">85</a>, <a href="#Vulgate_87" class="tei tei-ref">87</a> below), which preserve on
the whole a pure Hieronymian text, but are coloured here and
there from the earlier versions. Variation was still further
increased by the apparently numerous local or provincial
recensions which were made, sometimes anonymously, sometimes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under the editorship of famous men. Many of the Irish
MSS., for instance, seem to have been corrected immediately
from the Greek; but the two most notable recensions of the
text came, not, as we might have expected, directly from Rome, but
from Gaul; they are those of Alcuin and Theodulf in the ninth
century. That of Alcuin was undertaken at the desire of Charles
the Great<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>, who bade him (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 797) review and correct certain
copies by the best Latin MSS. without reference to the original
Greek. Charles' motive was not so much critical as a wish to
obtain a standard Bible for church use, and consequently of simple
and intelligible Latin. Alcuin obtained bibles for this purpose

that Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrid had brought the bibles and other
books collected in Rome and elsewhere during their journeys;
and it was in Northumbria that the magnificent Anglian texts
(such as those numbered 29, 64, 82, 91, &amp;c.) were written,
perpetuating the pure Vulgate text contained at that time in
the Roman MSS.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>

About the same time, Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans (787-821),
undertook a similar revision, and not of a less scientific
character, but followed a different method. Theodulf, himself
a Visigoth and born near Narbonne, seems to have done little
more than introduce into France the Spanish type of MSS., which
was mixed, confused, full of interpolations, and of very slight
critical value<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a>; this however he corrected carefully and enriched
with a large number of marginal readings. This revision is
preserved for us in the Theodulfian Bible at Paris (no. <a href="#Vulgate_18" class="tei tei-ref">18</a> below),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
less correctly in its sister volume at Puy (no. <a href="#Vulgate_24" class="tei tei-ref">24</a>), the Paris MS.

Two centuries later the text had again degenerated, and our
Primate Lanfranc (1069-89) attempted a similar task, perhaps
rather with a view to theology than textual criticism (<span class="tei tei-q">“secundum
orthodoxam fidem studuit corrigere”</span>)<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a>. In 1109 Stephen Harding,
third abbot of Citeaux, made a further revision, partly from good
Latin MSS., partly from the Greek, partly, in the Old Testament,
from the Hebrew, as he obtained help from some learned Jewish
scholars<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>. In 1150 his example was followed by Cardinal
Nicolaus Maniacoria<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>. As these individual efforts seemed to have
but slight success, the task was taken up in the thirteenth century
more fully and systematically by bodies of scholars, in the so-called
<span class="tei tei-q">“Correctoria Bibliorum;”</span> here the variant readings with their
authorities, Greek, Latin, ancient, modern, and citations from the
Fathers, were carefully registered. The most noticeable examples
of these correctoria are (1) the <span class="tei tei-q">“Correctorium Parisiense”</span> prepared
by the Paris theologians. Roger Bacon had a poor opinion of the
work done by these students; for some time the MSS. of the
Bible that were copied and bought and sold in Paris, he says,
were corrupt; they were bad to begin with, and copied carelessly
by the booksellers and their scribes, while the theologians were
not learned enough to discover and amend the mistakes<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>. This
correctorium is also frequently, but according to Denifle (p. 284)
wrongly, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senonense</span></span>, as if it was undertaken at the instance
of the Bishop of Sens; there is, however, no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">correctorium
Senonense</span></span>, only the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">correctiones Senonenses</span></span>, i.e. corrections
made in the Paris Correctorium by the Dominicans residing at
Sens; (2) the <span class="tei tei-q">“Correctorium”</span> of the Dominicans, prepared under
the auspices of Hugo de S. Caro, about 1240, the final corrected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
form of which is now preserved at Paris, B.N. Lat. 16719-16722
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below, p. <a href="#Pg070" class="tei tei-ref">70</a>, no. <a href="#Vulgate_23" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>)<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>; this, however, was again an attempt,
not so much to get at Jerome's actual text as, to bring
the Latin text into accordance with the Greek or Hebrew<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>;
(3) a better and more critical revision, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Correctorium
Vaticanum,”</span> a good MS. of which is in the Vatican Library
(Lat. 3466); the author of this has done his best to restore
Jerome's reading throughout, although well learned in Greek and
Hebrew; and he has with some probability been identified by
Vercellone with a scholar much praised by Roger Bacon as
a <span class="tei tei-q">“sapientissimus homo,”</span> who had spent nearly forty years in
the correction of the text<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> (Denifle suggests Wilh. de Mara).

These remedies, partial and temporary as they were, seemed
all that was possible before the invention of printing; and,

Among the earliest productions of the press, Latin Bibles took
a prominent position; and during the first half-century of printing
at least 124 editions were published<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>. Of these perhaps the
finest is the earliest, the famous <span class="tei tei-q">“forty-two line”</span> Bible, issued at
Mentz between 1452 and 1456, in two volumes, and usually
ascribed to Gutenberg<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>. This is usually called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mazarin
Bible,”</span> from the copy which first attracted the notice of bibliographers
having been discovered in the Library of Cardinal
Mazarin; in the New Testament, the order of books is Evv.,
Paul., Act., Cath., Apoc. Mr. Copinger enumerates twenty-five
copies on vellum and paper as still known to exist; there are two
in the British Museum. The first Bible published at Rome is dated
1471, and was printed by Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold
Pannartz, two vols., folio; the first octavo edition, or <span class="tei tei-q">“poor man's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bible,”</span> was printed at Basle in 1491 by Froben. The early
editions, however, reproduced the current mediaeval type of text,
or copied from each other, the only exceptions being those
printed by Froben, whose copies, says Mr. Copinger, were sought
after, for their accuracy, by the best scholars in Europe, and
whose edition of 1502 with the <span class="tei tei-q">“glossa ordinaria”</span> sometimes
stands quite alone in possessing the true reading. The first,
edition with a collection of various readings appears to be one
published at Paris in 1504<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>, followed by others at Venice and
Lyons in 1511, 1513; and a definite revision of the text was
attempted by Cardinal Ximenes, in the famous Complutensian
Polyglott (1514, &amp;c.; see Chap. <a href="#Chapter_V" class="tei tei-ref">V</a>)<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a>, in which he made use of
the Bible of Alcalá (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below, no. <a href="#Vulgate_42" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>); but though an advance
was made on previous editions, the text was still far from pure.
Erasmus, in his famous edition of the Greek Testament, appended
a Latin translation; this he made himself directly from the Greek,
but in his notes he discusses the current Vulgate text and gives
readings from MSS. which he had examined; of these he mentions
those at the Royal Library at Mechlin, St. Paul's Cathedral,
London, Corsendonk Austin Priory, Constance Cathedral, St.
Donatian (Abbaye des Dunes) of Bruges; of these the first and
third only can be now identified, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below, pp. <a href="#Pg084" class="tei tei-ref">84</a>, <a href="#Pg081" class="tei tei-ref">81</a>, nos.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>

the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exemplar S. Germani parvum</span></span> (Par. lat. 11937), the Corbey
Bible (Par. lat. 11532-3), and the Bible of St. Denis (Par. lat. 2);

edition in 1538-40 (reprinted 1546), in which he made use of
seventeen MSS., of which the following<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>, numbered <a href="#Vulgate_19" class="tei tei-ref">19</a>, <a href="#Vulgate_21" class="tei tei-ref">21</a>, <a href="#Vulgate_22" class="tei tei-ref">22</a>,

the corrected editions published by Th. Vivian (Paris), and Junta
(Venice), 1534 (both are small copies of the New Testament,
corrected occasionally from the Greek), Isidore Clarius (Venice,
1542), J. Benedictus (Paris, 1558), Paul Eber (1565), and Luke
Osiander (1578).

When the Council of Trent met, the duty of providing for the
members of the Church of Rome the most correct recension of
the Latin Bible that skill and diligence could produce was
obviously incumbent on it; and in one of its earliest sittings
(April 8, 1546) the famous decree was passed, ordaining that of
the many published editions of the Holy Scripture <span class="tei tei-q">“haec ipsa
vetus et vulgata editio, quae longo tot saeculorum usu in ipsa
ecclesia probata est”</span> should be chosen, and <span class="tei tei-q">“in publicis lectionibus,
disputationibus, praedicationibus, et expositionibus pro <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authentica</span></em>
habeatur”</span> (Sess. iv. Decr. 2); and directing that <span class="tei tei-q">“posthac
sacra Scriptura, potissimum vero haec ipsa vetus et vulgata
editio quam emendatissime imprimatur.”</span> No immediate action,
however, was taken in the matter, and for forty years the
editions were still printed and published by private scholars;
the Hentenian, for the time being, becoming almost the standard
text of the Roman Catholic Church.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Pius IV had indeed begun the task of correcting the
Vulgate Bible, but without immediate result, and under his
successors the matter still rested, till the accession of Sixtus V
(1585-90)<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>, a Pope as energetic in his labours on the Holy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Scripture as in other spheres of activity. He appointed a
commission on the subject, under the presidency of Cardinal
Carafa; and after they had presented the Pope with the result
of their work, in the beginning of 1589, he devoted himself
personally to the study, reading through the whole Bible more
than once, and using his best endeavours to bring it to the
highest pitch of accuracy. The result of this appeared in a folio
edition of the Bible in three volumes, in 1590<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>, accompanied by a
Bull, in which, after relating the extreme care that had been taken
in preparing the volume, Sixtus V declared that it was to be
considered as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authentic</span></em> edition recommended by the Council
of Trent, that it should be taken as the standard of all future
reprints, and that all copies should be corrected by it. The
edition itself (cited by Wordsworth as [Gothic: S]) was not without faults,
and indeed received a good number of corrections by hand after
the proofs were printed off; it presents a text more nearly
resembling that of Robt. Stephen than that of John Hentenius.
In a few months, however, Sixtus was dead; a number of short-lived
Popes succeeded him, and in Jan. 1592, Clement VIII
ascended the throne. Almost immediately he gave orders for the
copies of the Sixtine Vulgate to be called in; it has been hitherto
supposed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simply</span></em> on account of its inaccuracy, but Professor Nestle
(pp. 17 ff.) argues reasonably enough that this ground is insufficient,
and suggests that the revocation was really due to the
influence of the Jesuits, whom Sixtus had offended by placing
one of Bellarmine's books on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Index Librorum prohibitorum</span></span>.
Be that as it may, in the same year the Clementine edition of
the Vulgate (Wordsworth's [Gothic: C]) was published, differing from the
Sixtine in many places, and presenting a type of text more nearly
allied to Hentenius' Bible. To avoid the appearance of a conflict
between the two Popes, the Clementine Bible was boldly published
under the name of Sixtus, with a preface by Bellarmine asserting
that Sixtus had intended to bring out a new edition in consequence
of errors that had occurred in the printing of the first,
but had been prevented by death; now, in accordance with his
desire, the work was completed by his successor. The opportunity,
however, was too good a one for Protestants to miss, and
Thomas James in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Bellum Papale sive Concordia discors”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(London, 1600), upbraids the two Popes on their high pretensions
and the palpable failure of at least one, possibly both of them<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>.

From this time forward the Clementine Vulgate (sometimes
under the name of Clement, sometimes under that of Sixtus,
sometimes under both names)<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> has been the standard edition for
the Roman Church; by the Bull of 1592, every edition must be

even variant readings printed in the margin<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>.

The design of Bentley for a critical Greek Testament is
described below (Chap. <a href="#Chapter_V" class="tei tei-ref">V</a>); it was obvious that for its prosecution
the MSS. of the Vulgate would have to be collated as
carefully as those of the Greek text itself; and accordingly the
variant readings of a good number were collected by Bentley
himself, nos. 3, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72,
74, 75, 76, 77, 82, 83, 85, 155, 160; other MSS. were collated by
his friend and colleague John Walker, who worked much at
Paris in 1719 and the following years; to him we owe collations
of nos. 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 52, 96, 97, 102, 151, 164, while
he obtained collations of the Tours MSS. (nos. 106, 107, 108, 166)

of the Oxford MSS. (nos. 86, 87, 89, 90, 148, 161), from David
Casley. Walker died, however, in November, 1741, six months
before the great Bentley, and the projected edition came to
naught<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>. Their collations have not been published, but are

Two attempts are being made now to restore the text of St.
Jerome: that of Dr. Peter Corssen, of Berlin, and the Oxford
edition under the hands of the Bishop of Salisbury. Dr. Corssen's
published results at present consist only of the Epistle to the
Galatians (<span class="tei tei-q">“Epistula ad Galatas,”</span> Berlin, Weidmann, 1885), but he
has been spending several years in the accumulation of material,
and other books of the New Testament will probably be published
before very long. The Bishop of Salisbury after nearly eleven
years' preparation, in conjunction with the Rev. H. J. White and
other friends, published the first volume of his edition, containing
St. Matthew's Gospel, in 1889; St. Mark following in 1891, and
St. Luke in 1892; and it is hoped that the rest of the New
Testament may be published in due course. More than thirty
MSS., those numbered 5, 6, 18, 21, 28, 29, 37, 41, 51, 56, 64, 67,
68, 72, 77, 78, 82, 85, 86, 87, 91, 97, 98, 106, 115, 128, 129, 130,
132, 147, 148, 153, 154, 159, 175 below, have been carefully
collated throughout for this edition, and a large number of others

To enumerate all the known MSS. of the Old Latin version
was an easy task; to enumerate those of the Vulgate is almost
impossible. It is computed that there are at least 8,000 scattered
throughout the various Libraries of Europe, and M. Samuel
Berger, the greatest living authority on the subject, has examined
more than 800 in Paris alone. Nor would an exhaustive
enumeration be of much critical value, as a large number of
comparatively late MSS. probably contain the same corrupt type
of text.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The critical worth of the Egyptian versions has only recently
been appreciated as it deserves, and the reader is indebted
for the following account of them to the liberal kindness of one of
the few English scholars acquainted with the languages in which
they are written, the Rev. J. B. Lightfoot, D.D., then Canon of
St. Paul's, and Hulsean Professor of Divinity at Cambridge;
who, in the midst of varied and pressing occupations, found
time to comply with my urgent, though somewhat unreasonable,
request for his invaluable aid in this particular for the benefit
of the second edition of the present work. His yet more arduous
labours, as Bishop of Durham (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cui quando ullum inveniemus
parem?</span></span>) did not hinder him from revising his contribution for
the enriching of the third edition of this work. In this, the
fourth edition, the Editor has the pleasure of acknowledging the
most valuable help of the Rev. G. Horner, who has in particular
revised the description of the MSS. of the Bohairic version, and
of the Rev. A. C. Headlam, Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford,
who has added the result of more recent research. Mr. Headlam's
additions, are, wherever it is possible, distinguished by being
enclosed in square brackets.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most ancient authors, from Herodotus downwards, referring
to the heathen period of Egyptian history, mention two distinct
modes of writing; the sacred and the common. In place of the
former, however, Clement of Alexandria (Strom. v. 4, p. 657), who
has left the most precise account of Egyptian writing, substitutes
two modes, which he designates <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hieroglyphic</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hieratic</span></span> (or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
priestly) respectively; but since the hieratic is only a cursive
adaptation of the hieroglyphic, the two are treated as one by
other writers under the common designation of <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred”</span> (ἱερά).
Both these forms of the sacred writing are abundantly represented
in extant monuments, the one chiefly in sculptured stone,
the other on papyrus rolls, as we might have anticipated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The common writing is designated by various names. It is
sometimes the <span class="tei tei-q">“demotic”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“vulgar”</span> (δημοτικά Herod. ii. 36,
δημώδη Diod. iii. 3); sometimes the <span class="tei tei-q">“native”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“enchorial”</span>
(ἐγχωρία in the trilingual inscriptions of Rosetta and Philae);
sometimes <span class="tei tei-q">“epistolographic”</span> or letter-writer's character (Clem.
Alex. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>); and in a bilingual inscription recently (1866) discovered
at Tanis (Reinisch u. Roesler, Die zweisprachige Inschrift
von Tanis, Wien, 1866, p. 55), it is called <span class="tei tei-q">“Egyptian”</span>
simply (ἱεροῖς γράμμασιν καὶ Αἰγυπτίοις καὶ Ἑλληνικοῖς). This last
designation, as Lepsius remarks (Zeitschr. f. Aegyptische Sprache,
iv. p. 30, 1866), shows how completely the common writing had
outstripped the two forms of sacred character at the time of this
inscription, the ninth year of Ptolemy Euergetes I. This demotic
character also is represented in a large number of extant papyri
of various ages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These two modes of writing, however—the sacred and the
vulgar—besides the difference in external character exhibit also
two different languages, or rather (to speak more correctly) two
different forms of the same language. Of ancient writers indeed
the Egyptian Manetho alone mentions the existence of two such
forms (Joseph. c. Ap. i. 14), saying that in the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyksos</span></span> the
first syllable is taken from <span class="tei tei-q">“the sacred tongue”</span> (τὴν ἱερὰν γλῶσσαν),
the second from the <span class="tei tei-q">“common dialect”</span> (τὴν κοινὴν διάλεκτον):
but this solitary and incidental notice is fully borne out by the
extant monuments. The sacred character, whether hieroglyphic
or hieratic, presents a much more archaic type of the Egyptian
language than the demotic, differing from it very considerably,
though the two are used concurrently. The connexion of the
two may be illustrated by the relation of the Latin and the
Italian, as the ecclesiastical and vulgar tongues respectively of
mediaeval Italy. The sacred language had originally been the
ordinary speech of Egypt; but having become antiquated in
common conversation it survived for sacred uses alone. Unlike
the Latin however, it retained its archaic written character
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
along with its archaic grammatical forms. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">See</span></span> Brugsch, De
Natura et Indole Linguae Popularis Aegyptiorum, Berlin, 1850,
p. 1 sq.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest example of this demotic or enchorial or vulgar
writing belongs to the age of Psammetichus (the latter part of
the seventh century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>); while the latest example of which I
have found a notice must be referred to some time between the
years <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 165-169, as the titles (Armeniacus, Parthicus, &amp;c.)
given to the joint sovereigns M. Aurelius and L. Verus show<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>.
During the whole of this period, comprising more than eight
centuries, the sacred dialect and character are used concurrently
with the demotic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coptic</span></span> is applied to the Egyptian language as spoken
and written by Christian people and in Christian times. It is
derived from the earliest Arabic conquerors of Egypt, who speak
of their native Christian subjects as Copts. No instance of this
appellation is found in native Coptic writers, with one very late
and doubtful exception (Zoega, Catal., p. 648). Whence they
obtained this designation, has been a subject of much discussion.
Several theories which have been broached to explain the word
will be found in J. S. Assemani, Della Nazione dei Copti, &amp;c.,
p. 172 (printed in Mai, Script. Vet. Coll., V. P. 2), and in Quatremère,
Recherches Critiques et Historiques sur la Langue et la
Littérature de l'Égypte, Paris, 1808, p. 30 sq. A very obvious
and commonly adopted derivation is that which connects it
with the town Coptos in Upper Egypt; but as this place was
not at that time prominent or representative, and did not lie
directly across the path of the Arab invaders, no sufficient
reason appears why it should have been singled out as a designation
of the whole country. In earlier ages, however, it seems
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to have been a much more important place, both strategically and
commercially (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Brugsch, Die Geographie des alten Ägyptens,
i. p. 200; Egypt under the Pharaohs, i. p. 212 sq., Eng. trans.).
Even as late as the Roman epoch Strabo (xvii. p. 815) describes
it as <span class="tei tei-q">“a city with a mixed population of Egyptians and Arabians”</span>
(πόλιν κοινὲν Αἰγυπτίων τε καὶ Ἀράβων), and elsewhere (xvi. p. 781)
he mentions it as a station of Egyptian traffic with Arabia and
India. Possibly therefore this Arabic name for the Egyptians is
a survival of those early times. On the whole, however, it seems
more probable that the Arabic word is a modification of the
Greek Αἰγύπτιος (Schwartze, Das alte Aegypten, i. p. 956). [And
this derivation seems now to be generally accepted, the Greek
word αἰγύπτιος being represented in Coptic by ⲄⲨⲠⲦⲒⲞⲤ, or
ⲔⲨⲠⲦⲀⲒⲞⲤ, whence came <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Qibt</span></span> (the common form) and our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coptic</span></span>. (Stern, Koptische Grammatik, p. 1.)]
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this account it will appear that the Coptic, as a language,
cannot differ materially from the demotic. As a matter
of fact the two are found on examination to represent two successive
stages of the same language—a result which history
would lead us to anticipate. But while the language is essentially
the same, the character of the writing is wholly different.
The demotic character was derived ultimately from the hieroglyphic.
Hence it represents the same medley of signs. Only
a small number are truly alphabetic, i.e. denote each a single
sound. Others represent syllables. Others again, and these
a very large number, are not phonetic at all, but pictorial.
Of these pictorial or ideographic signs again there are several
kinds; some represent the thing itself directly; others recall it
by a symbol; others again are determinative, i.e. exhibit the
class or type, to which the object or action belongs. It is
strange that this very confused, cumbrous, and uncertain mode
of writing should have held its ground for so many centuries,
while all the nations around employed strictly phonetic alphabets;
but Egypt was proverbially a land of the past, and some
sudden shock was necessary to break up a time-honoured usage
like this and to effect a literary revolution. This moral earthquake
came at length in Christianity. Coincidently with the
evangelization of Egypt and the introduction of a Christian
literature, we meet with a new and strictly phonetic alphabet.
This new Egyptian or Coptic alphabet comprises thirty letters,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of which twenty-four are adopted from the Greek alphabet,
while the remaining six, of which five represent sounds peculiar
to the Egyptian language and the sixth is an aspirate, are signs
borrowed from the existing Egyptian writing. If there is no
direct historical evidence that this alphabet was directly due to
Christianity, yet the coincidence of time and historic probability
generally point to this. The Christians indeed had a very
powerful reason for changing the character, besides literary convenience.
The demotic writing was interspersed with figures
of the Egyptian deities, used as symbolic or alphabetical signs.
It must have been a suggestion of propriety, if not a dictate
of conscience, in translating and transcribing the Scriptures to
exclude these profane and incongruous elements from the
sacred text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The date at which this important change was introduced into
Egyptian writing has been a matter of much dispute. If it is
correctly attributed to Christian influences, the new alphabet
must have been coeval with the birth of a native Christian
literature in Egypt. The earliest extant remains of such a literature,
to which we can fix a date with any certainty, are the
Epistles of St. Antony (who was born about the middle of the
third century) to Athanasius and Theodore; but, as we shall
see presently, one or both of the two principal Egyptian versions
must have been already in common use at this time. Indeed,
if the date assigned to a recently discovered writing be correct,
the introduction of the new character was much earlier than
this. On the back of a papyrus in the British Museum, containing
the Funeral Oration of Hyperides, is a horoscope in
Greek and Egyptian, the latter written in Greek characters,
with the additional six letters almost, though not quite, identical
with the forms in the ordinary Coptic alphabet. Mr. C. W.
Goodwin, who describes this important document in Chabas,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mélanges Égyptologiques,”</span> 2me série, p. 294 sq., and in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Zeitschrift für Aegyptische Sprache,”</span> vi. p. 18 sq., February, 1868,
calculates (though he does not speak confidently) that it is the
horoscope of a person born <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 154<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Any account of the Coptic dialects must start from the well-known
passage in the Copto-Arabic grammar of Athanasius,
bishop of Kos in the Thebaid, who flourished in the eleventh
century. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Coptic language,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“is divided into
three dialects; that is to say, the Coptic dialect of Misr, which
is the same as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sahidic</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bohairic</span></span><a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>, which gets its name
from the province of Bohairah; and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bashmuric</span></span> in use in the
region of Bashmur. At the present time only the Bohairic and
Sahidic continue to be used. These different dialects are derived
from one and the same language”</span> (quoted in Quatremère, Sur la
Langue &amp;c., p. 20 sq.). For the present I will dismiss the
Bashmuric, as it will require further investigation hereafter.
The remaining two, the Bohairic and Sahidic, were the principal
dialects of the language, being spoken in Lower and Upper
Egypt respectively; and are largely represented in extant
remains of biblical and ecclesiastical literature<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Sahidic and Bohairic dialects are well defined and
separate from each other. Among other distinctive features
the Sahidic delights in the multiplication of vowels as compared
with the Bohairic; thus it has ⲉⲗⲉⲟⲟⲗⲉ for ⲁⲗⲟⲗⲓ,
ⲙⲏⲏⲱⲉ for ⲙⲏⲱ, ϩⲁⲗⲁⲁⲧⲉ for ϩⲁⲗⲁⲧⲓ, ϣⲉⲗⲉⲉⲧ for
ϣⲉⲗⲉⲧ, &amp;c. Again the Sahidic has smooth-breathings where
the Bohairic has aspirates, e.g. ⲡⲏⲩⲉ for ⲫⲏⲩⲓ <span class="tei tei-q">“heavens,”</span>
ⲧⲏⲩ for ⲑⲏⲟⲩ <span class="tei tei-q">“wind”</span>; and it substitutes the simple aspirate
for the stronger guttural, e.g. ⲱⲛϩ for ⲱⲛⲭ <span class="tei tei-q">“life,”</span> ⲡⲁϩ
for ⲫⲁϧ <span class="tei tei-q">“rend.”</span> Besides these more general distinctions, the
two dialects have special peculiarities, not only in their grammatical
forms, but even in their ordinary vocabulary; thus
Sah. ⲃⲱⲕ for Boh. ⲓ <span class="tei tei-q">“to go,”</span> Sah. ϩⲉ for Boh. ⲣⲏϯ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“manner,”</span> Sah. ϩⲁϩ for Boh. ⲙⲏϣ <span class="tei tei-q">“a multitude,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“many,”</span>
and so forth. Indeed the relations of the Sahidic and Bohairic
dialects to each other may be fairly illustrated, as will have
appeared from these facts, by the relation of the Ionic and Attic,
though the differences in the Egyptian dialects are greater than
in the Greek. Like the Attic, the Bohairic is the more literary
and cultivated dialect of the two.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The demotic writing does not give the slightest indication
that there were different dialects of the spoken language (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
Brugsch, Grammaire Démotique, p. 10). In the Coptic, i.e.
Christian, literature we learn this fact for the first time; and
yet in the earliest age of this literature the dialects are found
to be fully developed. Brugsch, however, has shown (De Natura
&amp;c., p. 10) that transcriptions of several Egyptian words into
Greek in the age of the Ptolemies occur in two different forms,
which correspond fairly to the two dialects; and indeed it would
seem probable that the separation of the Bohairic and Sahidic
should be ascribed to the more remote time, when these regions
formed separate kingdoms. The older Egyptian writing, whether
sacred or demotic, would obscure the distinction of dialects,
partly from a conservative fondness for time-honoured modes
of representation, but chiefly owing to the nature of the character
itself. Thus this character makes no provision for the nicer
distinction of the vowel-sounds, while the dialectic differences
depend very largely on the divergent vocalization. Thus again
it sometimes represents allied consonants, such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span>, by the
same sign; while one of the most striking peculiarities of dialect
is the common substitution of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span> in the dialect of the Fayoum
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span> in the Sahidic and Bohairic, as e.g. ⲏⲗⲡ for ⲏⲣⲡ <span class="tei tei-q">“wine,”</span>
ⲗⲁⲙⲡⲓ for ⲣⲟⲙⲡⲓ <span class="tei tei-q">“year,”</span> ⲗⲓⲙⲓ for ⲣⲓⲙⲓ <span class="tei tei-q">“weeping,”</span> and
the like.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the time when the Scriptures were translated into the
two principal dialects of Egypt no direct record is preserved.
Judging, however, from the analogy of the Latin and Syriac
and other early versions, and indeed from the exigencies of the
case, we may safely infer that as soon as the Gospel began to
spread among the native Egyptians who were unacquainted
with Greek, the New Testament, or at all events some parts of
it, would be translated without delay. Thus we should probably
not be exaggerating, if we placed one or both of the principal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Egyptian versions, the Bohairic and the Sahidic, or at least
parts of them, before the close of the second century<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>. There
are, so far as I am aware, no phenomena whether of text or of
interpretation in either, which are inconsistent with this early
date. Somewhat later than this we meet with notices which
certainly presuppose the common use of a native version or versions
of the Scriptures. Quatremère (Sur la Langue &amp;c., p. 9 sq.)
and Schwartze (Das alte Aegypten, p. 956 sq.) have collected
a number of such notices, from which we may gather that it was
the exception and not the rule, when a native Egyptian bishop
or monk in the early centuries could speak the Greek language
besides his own. Thus for instance St. Antony, who was born
about the year 250, could only speak his native tongue, and in
conversing with Greeks was obliged to use an interpreter (Athan.,
Vit. Ant. 74; Hieron., Vit. Hilar. 30; Pallad., Hist. Laus. 26).
His own letters, of which fragments are extant, were written in
Egyptian. Yet he was a son of Christian parents, and as a
boy listened constantly to the reading of the Scriptures (Athan.,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>, § 1). When only eighteen or twenty years old, we are told,
he was powerfully influenced by hearing the Gospel read in
church (§§ 2, 3); and throughout his life he was a diligent reader
and expositor of the Scriptures. Indeed it is quite plain from
repeated notices, that the Scriptures in the Egyptian tongue
were widely circulated and easily accessible at this time (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
esp. § 16 ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς [i.e. τοῖς μοναχοῖς] τῇ Αἰγυπτιακῇ φωνῇ
ταῦτα; τὰς μὲν γραφὰς ἱκανὰς εἶναι πρὸς διδασκαλίαν κ.τ.λ.). Again
his contemporary Theodore, a famous abbot to whom one of his
letters is addressed, was equally ignorant of any language
but his own, and had to use an interpreter in speaking with
strangers and Alexandrians (Sahid. MS. clxxvii in Zoega, Catal.,
p. 371). The notices of Theodore's master Pachomius, the
founder of Egyptian monasteries, point in the same direction.
This famous person, who was converted as a young man in the
early years of the fourth century, was till late in life unacquainted
with any language but his own. Receiving a visit from an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Alexandrian, another Theodore, he assigned to him as his
companion and interpreter a monk who could speak Greek.
After some time he himself applied himself to the study of this
language that he might be able to converse with his new friend
(Zoega, p. 77 sq., and references in Quatremère, Sur la Langue &amp;c,
p. 12). Pachomius drew up rules for the guidance of his
monastery in the Egyptian language. These rules, which are
extant in Greek and Latin translations (Migne, Patrol. Graec., xl.
p. 947; Hieron., Op., ii. p. 53 sq.), demand a very diligent study
of the Scriptures from the brethren, even from novices before
admission into the order. Again and again directions are given
relating to the use of manuscripts. These notices indeed refer
chiefly to the Thebaid, which was the great seat of the Egyptian
monasteries; but the first part of St. Antony's life was spent
in the monasteries of Alexandria, and it was only later that he
retired to the Thebaid (Athan., Vit. Ant. 49). Though probably
more common in Lower than in Upper Egypt, the knowledge
of Greek was even there an accomplishment denied to a large
number of native Christians. Thus for instance, when Palladius
visited John of Lycopolis, an abbot of the Nitrian desert, he
found his knowledge of Greek so slight that he could only
converse through an interpreter (Hist. Laus. 43). These, it will
be remembered, are the most prominent names among the
Egyptian Christians; and from such examples it must be plain
that the ordinary monk would be wholly dependent on a native
version for his knowledge of the Scriptures. Yet the monks
swarmed both in Upper and Lower Egypt at this time. Palladius
reckons as many as 7,000 brethren under Pachomius in the
Tabennitic monastery (Hist. Laus. 38; comp. Hieron., Praef. in
Reg. Pach. 2, ii. p. 54), while Jerome states that close upon
50,000 would assemble together at the chief monastery of the
order to celebrate the anniversary of the Lord's Passion (ib. § 7).
After all allowance made for exaggeration, the numbers must
have been very great. Even at a much later date the heads of
the Egyptian Church were often wholly dependent on their
native tongue. At the Robber Synod of Ephesus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 449)
Calosirius, bishop of Arsinoe, spoke and signed through his
deacon, who acted as interpreter (Labb., Conc. iv. p. 1119, 1179,
1188, ed. Colet.). And again two years later, when Dioscorus
of Alexandria started for the Council of Chalcedon, he was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accompanied by one Macarius, bishop of Tkou, a man of some
note in his day, who could not be made to understand a word
of Greek (Memph. MS. liv, in Zoega, Catal., p. 99).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
[The above was the most complete account of the dialects
of the Coptic language and of the early history of the Coptic
versions at the time when it was written; but in the last ten
years immense additions have been made to our knowledge—additions
which have rather complicated than solved the problem.
These have been mainly due to the process of new discovery
and to the labour of many scholars. A large number of
previously unedited Coptic MSS. have been published; many
new MSS. have been discovered, and the grammar of the
language has been studied with great minuteness. The credit of
the discovery and editing of new MSS. must be largely given to
the energy and industry of the French school at Cairo, and
especially to a former member of it, M. Amélineau, who has
published a very large number of texts; the advances in our
knowledge of the grammar are due to the labours of the German
school of Egyptologists, notably Stern, Erman, and Steindorff.
More important in some ways has been the discovery of an
immense number of documents of a completely new class,
written on papyrus, partly in and near the Fayoum, but also
throughout the whole of Upper Egypt. These documents present
us with the language in an earlier stage than we had previously
known, and in a class of writings such as letters, contracts, and
other legal documents, which conform to the spoken language of
different parts of Egypt<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is on the subject of the Egyptian dialects that our views
have been most modified. We have seen that three dialects in
all are mentioned by Athanasius of Cos: the Bohairic, the
Sahidic, and a third, the Bashmuric. When therefore fragments
of a third version of the Scriptures were discovered, the name
Bashmuric was at once assigned to them. The early history of
the discussions on this dialect were admirably summed up by
Bishop Lightfoot. (3rd edition, pp. 401-403.)]
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first fragment, 1 Cor. ix. 9-16, was published at Rome
in 1789 by Giorgi, from a MS. in the Borgian Museum, in the
work which has been already mentioned. He designated it
Bashmuric, and, as the dialect presents affinities to both the
Bohairic and Sahidic, he assigned to it a corresponding locality.
Herodotus (ii. 42) mentions the inhabitants of the
Ammonian Oasis as speaking a language intermediate between
the Egyptian and Ethiopian; and on the strength of this passage,
combined with the phenomena just mentioned, Giorgi placed
Bashmur in this region, deriving the word from the Coptic
ⲥⲡⲁⲙⲏⲣ <span class="tei tei-q">“the region beyond,”</span> i.e. west of the Nile, and gave
the dialect a second name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ammonian</span></span> (p. lxviii sq.). In the
same year Münter in his work on the Sahidic dialect (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
above, p. 393), published this same fragment independently at
Copenhagen. He had not seen Giorgi's work, but adopted
provisionally his name Ammonian, of which he had heard, while
at the same time he stated his own opinion that the variations
of form are too slight to constitute a separate dialect (p. 76).
In 1808 appeared Quatremère's work, to which I have more
than once alluded. In it he included another fragment of
this dialect (Baruch iv. 22-v. 22, and Epist. Jerem.), from a MS.
in the Imperial Library of Paris. At the same time he pointed
out that the passage in Herodotus will not bear the interpretation
put upon it by Giorgi, and that, as a matter of fact, the
Ammonians speak not a Coptic, but a Berber dialect. He also
refuted Giorgi's opinion about the position of Bashmur, and
showed conclusively (p. 147 sq.) from several notices in Arabic
writers that this region must be placed in the Delta. In a later
work (Mémoires Géographiques et Historiques sur l'Égypte,
i. p. 233, 1811) he identified it more definitely with Elearchia,
the country of the Bucoli, that fierce and turbulent race of
herdsmen, who, living in the marshy pasture land and protected
by the branches of the Nile, gave so much trouble to their
Persian, Greek, and Roman rulers successively (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Engelbreth,
p. x). The defiant attitude, which in earlier times these Bucoli
assumed towards their successive masters, was maintained to the
end by the Bashmurites towards their Arab conquerors. While
the other Copts succumbed and made terms, they alone
stubbornly resisted. At length the Arab invaders were victorious,
and the Bashmuric race was extirpated. It would seem,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore, that Bashmur is the Arabic modification of the Coptic
ⲡⲥⲁⲙⲟⲩⲣ, <span class="tei tei-q">“regio cincta,”</span> the country girdled by the Nile.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this being so, Quatremère, looking at the linguistic
character of these fragments, denies that they belong to the
Bashmuric dialect at all; and suggests for them a locality which
will explain their affinities to both the Bohairic and Sahidic,
assigning them to the Great and Little Oasis, and accordingly
designating them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oasitic</span></span>. In 1810 Zoega's <span class="tei tei-q">“Catalogus,”</span> a
posthumous work, appeared, in which he published all the
fragments of this third Egyptian dialect found in the Borgian
collection, comprising (besides a portion of Isaiah) John iv. 28-53;
1 Cor. vi. 19-ix. 16; xiv. 33-xv. 35; Eph. vi. 18-24; Phil. i. 1-ii.
2; 1 Thess. i. 1-iii. 6; Heb. v. 5-9; v. 13-vi. 8-11; 15-vii.
5, 8-13; 16-x. 22, nearly all of these passages being more
or less mutilated. And in the following years these same
passages were edited by Engelbreth (Fragmenta Basmurico-Coptica
Veteris et Novi Testamenti, Havniae, 1811), who had
not seen Zoega's edition. Both Zoega and Engelbreth, though
agreeing with Quatremère in the position of Bashmur (the former
without having seen Quatremère's book), yet claimed these
fragments as Bashmuric.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this opinion there is good reason for acquiescing. It seems
highly improbable that Athanasius of Kos, a Christian bishop,
can have been ignorant of a dialect so important that the
Christian Scriptures were translated into it (for the various
fragments oblige us to suppose a complete version of the Old and
New Testaments), a dialect moreover which, on Quatremère's
hypothesis, was spoken not so very far from his own neighbourhood.
And on the other hand it is not very probable that all
traces of a dialect which was known to him should have perished,
as would be the case if these fragments are not Bashmuric<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>.
To counterbalance this twofold difficulty involved in Quatremère's
hypothesis, the linguistic objections ought to be serious
indeed. But until we are better acquainted with the early
history of Egypt than we are ever likely to be, it will be impossible
to say why the Bashmuric dialect should not be separated
geographically from the Sahidic by a dialect like the Bohairic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with which it has fewer, though still some special affinities. The
interposition of an Ionic between two Dorian races in Greece
will show the insecurity of this mode of argument.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
[We must now continue the history. Although Bishop
Lightfoot summed up in favour of the theory which would
assign these fragments to the Bashmuric, his acuteness had
noticed the difficulties which would be involved in the separation
of that dialect from the Sahidic, with which it had close
affinities by what was then called the Memphitic. The greater
knowledge of Egyptian history, which he desired but did not
hope for, has become possible. And the objection is supported.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1878 Stern examined the history and character of the
third Egyptian dialect (Z. A. S. 16, 1878, p. 23), and showed that
it was almost impossible on either linguistic or historical grounds
to assign it to the district of Bashmur. He pointed out that all
the fragments we possessed of it had come from Upper Egypt,
that we had positive evidence that there was no version of
the Scriptures in the Bashmuric dialect, and that in dialectic
affinities it was clearly akin to Sahidic. He also found evidence
in Tuki of the existence of another dialect there called Memphiticus
Alter, and that this was supported by papyrus documents
which came from the site of Memphis (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below), which have
some, although not a complete, resemblance to the Bashmuric
fragments. Hence he concluded that the third dialect was
Middle Egyptian, and, guided by two or three words on a
fragment of papyrus brought from the Fayoum, he decided that
that district must have presented the characters of isolation and
independence, which would make the development of a third
dialect possible. The proof of his theory was not long to seek.
Already in the year 1877 attention had been called to the
fragments now known as the Fayoum papyri, and very soon
they began to appear in European libraries; it was not long
before Berlin and Vienna acquired very large collections. An
examination of the Coptic papyri in these collections has proved
conclusively the truth of Stern's conclusions. The vast majority
of these present the same dialectic affinities as the third Bible
translation, and show also (as these had hinted) that the
orthography of the dialect was not fixed, in fact that hardly two
documents present exactly the same linguistic character, although
all are definitely distinguished from the other two dialects.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It may therefore be confidently asserted that all the literature
hitherto published as Bashmuric is in the dialect of the Fayoum.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the discoveries do not stop here. As early as 1876
M. E. Revillont had published (Papyrus Coptes, 1876, p. 103)
a collection of documents in the Louvre which came from the
Monastery of Abba Jeremias, close to the Serapeum, near the
site of the ancient Memphis. These were examined by Stern
(Z. A. S. 23, 1885, p. 145 sq.), who shows that here we have
again a different dialectic form. It has affinities to the Sahidic,
affinities to the Bohairic, and affinities to the Fayoum dialect.
It represents in fact the language of ancient Memphis, and an
attempt has been made to call it Memphitic, but this would
create endless confusion. Stern suggests Lower Sahidic (Unter
Sahidisch), but the name Middle Egyptian is the one which has
been generally adopted. It is this discovery that shows the
necessity of avoiding the term Memphitic for the principal
Egyptian version, and substituting the Arabic name 'Bohairic.'
That was the language of the province on the sea-coast in the
neighbourhood of Alexandria. And it was not until the eleventh
century, and the removal of the Patriarchate to Cairo, that it
became the language of the district of Memphis, that is, long
after the decline of Memphis had begun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But our knowledge of the dialects of Egypt was still further
to be extended. About ten years ago excavations were undertaken
by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities in the Coptic
Cemetery of Akhmîm, the ancient Chemnis or Panopolis in
Upper Egypt. Amongst the results of this discovery were the
Apocryphal fragments, which have created a considerable sensation
lately. These seem to have been considered by their
discoverers to possess so little interest, that they were only
accidentally given to the world seven years afterwards. The
Coptic fragments were more fortunate, and in 1884 M. Bouriant,
head of the French School at Cairo, published considerable
fragments of the Old Testament, including a hitherto unknown
Apocryphal work, the Testament of Sophonias (Zephaniah), in
a fifth dialect, to which, for some reason, he at the time gave
the name of Bashmuric (Mémoires, i. 1884, p. 243). This dialect
was examined by Stern (Z. A. S. 24, 1886, p. 129), who showed
that, while its affinities were with the Middle Egyptian or
Lower Sahidic, it represented a more primitive stage in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
language, and that these documents are our oldest literary
remains of the Coptic language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the place then of the two or three dialects known until
recent years, we have now at least five: the Bohairic, Sahidic,
Fayoumic, Middle Egyptian, and Akhmimic, not to speak of the
Bashmuric, in which no literary remains exist. The exact
relations of these dialects to one another have not yet been
satisfactorily worked out, and the problem is complicated by the
fact that most of them had no fixed or standard form, and that
papyri (especially those containing documents in the popular
speech) vary in every locality and every age. To write the
history then of these dialects and of the New Testament in them
is not at present possible; but the following may suggest some
more or less tentative conclusions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the earlier stages of the Egyptian language as we have it
now in a written form, there are apparently no certain signs of
dialectic variations, although there is certainly evidence that such
did exist in the spoken language; and the changes introduced by
Christianity are of great interest. The old language was fixed
and definite in its orthography, and it represented the traditions
of a caste of scribes, and not of the popular speech. Christianity
on the other hand was in Egypt a great popular movement;
a new and simple alphabet became necessary; the Scriptures
were translated, not into the literary language, but into that of
the people; and the copies of these translations in each locality
reflected the local peculiarities of speech which had existed for
centuries, but which up to that time had left behind no literary
memorial. Gradually, however, the Christian Church created
for itself literary traditions, and a tendency towards unification
set in round three centres, the monasteries of the Natron
Lakes, the great home of monastic life in Lower Egypt, the
monasteries of the Fayoum, and the great White Monastery
Deir Amba Shenoudah near Sohag in Upper Egypt. Hence
came the three dialects which have a more or less literary
character. Then began the decay of the Coptic language. First
the dialect of the Fayoum died out, then the Sahidic, until
finally Bohairic became, as it is now, the church language of the
whole country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation of these changes to the history of the versions
has not yet been satisfactorily worked out. It has been sufficiently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proved that translations into Coptic existed in the third
century, very probably in the second; but in what dialect
they were made, and what relation they bore to the existing
translations, has not yet been discovered, and the problem
remains unsolved.]

The Bohairic version was not included in the Polyglotts,
though others much later in date and inferior in quality found
a place there. The first use of it is found in Bp. Fell's Oxford
N. T. (1675), to which many readings were contributed by the
Oxford Oriental scholar, T. Marshall, Rector of Lincoln College,
who died in 1675, before the Coptic New Testament was published.
It was afterwards employed by Mill, who recognized its
importance, and gave various readings from it in the notes and
appendix to his edition of the Greek Testament (1707). These
readings he obtained partly from the papers of Marshall, who
had contemplated an edition of the Coptic Gospels, but was
prevented by death from accomplishing his design, and partly
from the communications of a foreign scholar, Lud. Piques.
The MSS. which supplied the former belonged at one time to
Marshall himself, and are now in the Bodleian; the latter were
taken from MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris (see Mill's <span class="tei tei-q">“Prol.,”</span>
pp. clii, clx, clxvii).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">editio princeps</span></span> of the Bohairic version appeared a few
years later with the title <span class="tei tei-q">“Novum Testamentum Aegyptium
vulgo Copticum ex MSS. Bodleianis descripsit, cum Vaticanis et
Parisiensibus contulit, et in Latinum sermonem convertit David
Wilkins Ecclesiae Anglicanae Presbyter, Oxon. 1716.”</span> The
editor Wilkins was a Prussian by birth, but an Oxonian by
adoption. In his preface he gives an account of the MSS. which
he used, and which will be described below. The materials at
his disposal were ample, if he had only known how to use
them; but unfortunately his knowledge of the language was not
thoroughly accurate, nor had he the critical capacity required
for such a task. His work was very severely criticized at the
time by two eminent Egyptian scholars, Jablonsky and La Croze,
whose verdict has been echoed by most subsequent writers; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no doubt it is disfigured by many inaccuracies. But he may
fairly claim the indulgence granted to pioneers in untrodden
fields of learning, and he has laid Biblical scholars under a debt
of gratitude which even greater errors of detail could not efface.
With some meagre exceptions this was the first work which had
appeared in the Egyptian tongue; and under these circumstances
much may be forgiven in an editor. The defects which render
caution necessary in using it for critical purposes are twofold.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First.</span></em> The text itself is not constructed on any consistent or
trustworthy principles. It is taken capriciously from one or
other of the sources at his disposal; no information is given
respecting the authority for the printed text in any particular
passage; and, as a rule, no various readings are added. In the
prolegomena indeed (p. xi sq.) notices of two or three variations
are given, but even here we have no specification of the MSS.
from which they are taken. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly.</span></em> The translation cannot
be trusted. The extent of this inaccuracy may be seen from the
examples in Woide, Append. Cod. Alex., p. 16 sq., and Schwartze,
Evang. Memph. Praef., p. xxii. One instance will suffice. In
1 Cor. xiii. 3 Wilkins gives the rendering <span class="tei tei-q">“ut comburar,”</span>
corresponding to the common reading ἵνα καυθήσωμαι; though
the Memphitic has ⲏⲧⲁ ϣⲟⲩϣⲟⲩ ⲙⲙⲟⲓ = ἵνα καυχήσωμαι.
Yet Wilkins' error has been so contagious that Tattam in his
Lexicon gives καίειν <span class="tei tei-q">“incendere”</span> as a sense of ϣⲟⲩϣⲟⲩ,
referring to this passage as an example, though its universal
meaning is <span class="tei tei-q">“to praise,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“to glorify.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1829 the British and Foreign Bible Society published an
edition of the Four Gospels in Coptic (Bohairic) and Arabic.
It is a handsomely printed 4to, intended for the use of the
native Christians of Egypt. In the Coptic portion, which was
edited by Tattam, the text of Wilkins was followed for the most
part, but it was corrected here and there from a recent MS.
which will be described below, Evang. 14. This edition has no
critical value.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between the edition of Wilkins and those of Schwartze and
Boetticher more than a century and a quarter elapsed; but no
important step was taken during this period towards a more
critical use of the Bohairic version. Wetstein appears to
have been satisfied with the information obtainable from Mill
and Wilkins. Bengel was furnished with a few various readings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the Berlin MSS. by La Croze; and Woide again in his
preface, p. 13, gave a collation of Mark i. from the Berlin MS.
of this Gospel. Griesbach seems not to have gone beyond
published sources of information; and this has been the case
with later editors of the Greek Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The title of Schwartze's edition is <span class="tei tei-q">“Quatuor Evangelia in
dialecto linguae Copticae Memphitica perscripta ad Codd. MS.
Copticorum in Regia Bibliotheca Berolinensi adservatorum nec
non libri a Wilkinsio emissi fidem edidit, emendavit, adnotationibus
criticis et grammaticis, variantibus lectionibus expositis
atque textu Coptico cum Graeco comparato instruxit M. G.
Schwartze.”</span> St. Matthew and St. Mark appeared in 1846,
St. Luke and St. John in the following year. The title of the
work fully explains its aim. The editor was an exact Egyptian
scholar, and so far it is thoroughly trustworthy. The defects of
this edition, however, for purposes of textual criticism are not
inconsiderable. (1) Schwartze's materials were wholly inadequate.
Though the libraries of England, Paris, and Rome contain
a large number of MSS. of different ages and qualities, not one
of these was consulted; but the editor confined himself to one
good MS. and one indifferent transcript, both in the Berlin
library. These will be described below. The text of the
Bohairic Gospels therefore still remains in a very unsatisfactory
state. (2) His collation with the Greek text is at once
superfluous and defective. This arises from his capricious
choice of standards of comparison, the Codex Ephraem and the
printed texts of Lachmann and Tischendorf (1843). If he had
given an accurate Latin translation of the whole, and had
supplemented this with a distinct statement of the reading of
the Bohairic version, where variations are known to exist in
other authorities, and where at the same time a Latin version
could not be made sufficiently explicit, the result would have
been at once more simple, more complete, and more available.
As it is, he has contented himself with translating particular
sentences (more especially those which are mistranslated in
Wilkins), while his method of comparison necessarily overlooks
many variations. With all its defects, however, this edition has
a far higher value than its predecessor for critical purposes.
Not the least useful part of Schwartze's notes is the collation of
the published portions of the Sahidic Version, where also he has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
corrected errors in the edition of Woide and Ford (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below,
p. <a href="#Pg129" class="tei tei-ref">129</a> sq.).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Schwartze only lived to complete the four Gospels. He had,
however, made some collations for the Acts and Epistles during
his last visit to England; and after his death they were placed
in the hands of P. Boetticher, who continued the work. The
titles of Boetticher's editions are <span class="tei tei-q">“Acta Apostolorum Coptice,”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“Epistulae Novi Testamenti Coptice,”</span> both dated Halae,
1852. His plan, however, differs wholly from Schwartze's. He
substitutes an 8vo size for the 4to of his predecessor; and he
gives no translation or collation with the Greek, but contents
himself with noting the variations of his MSS. in Coptic at the
foot of the page. Thus his book is absolutely useless to any one
who is unacquainted with the language. Moreover his materials,
though less scanty than Schwartze's, are far from adequate. For
the Acts and for the Catholic Epistles he employed Schwartze's
collations of two English MSS., which he calls <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tattamianus</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curetonianus</span></span>, and himself collated or obtained collations of two
others in the Paris Library (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">p</span></span>), (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>); while for the Pauline
Epistles he again used Schwartze's collations of the same two
English MSS., together with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> Paris MS. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">p</span></span>), and the
Berlin MSS., which will be described below. The account,
which he gives in his preface, of the MSS. employed by him is
so meagre, that in some cases they are with difficulty identified.
Nor again are the collations used for this edition nearly complete.
I have pointed out below the defects in Schwartze's collation of
one of the English MSS., which I have partially examined; and
Brugsch in an article in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeitschr. der Deutschen Morgenl.
Gesellsch.,”</span> vii. p. 115 sq. (1853), has given a full collation of the
Berlin MS. of the Epistle to the Romans, showing how many
variations in this MS. are not recorded in Boetticher's edition.
The Apocalypse has never appeared.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About the same time a magnificent edition of the whole of the

at the end, that the Book was edited by <span class="tei tei-q">“Henry Tattam the
presbyter of the Anglican Church for the Holy Patriarch and
the Church of Christ in Egypt.”</span> The type is large and bold, and
the volumes are very handsome in all respects, being designed
especially for Church use. The editor's eminent services to
Coptic literature are well known, but the titles and colophon do
not suggest any high expectations of the value of this edition to
the scholar. The basis of the text in this edition was a copy
belonging to the Coptic Patriarch; but the editor collated it
with MSS. in his own possession and with others belonging to
the Hon. R. Curzon, adopting from these such variations as
seemed to him to agree with the best readings of the Greek
MSS. As no various readings are recorded, this edition is quite
useless for critical purposes: nor indeed was the aim which the
editor set before him consistent with the reproduction of the
Bohairic New Testament in its authentic form. The interpolated
passages for instance are printed without any indication
that their authority is at all doubtful.

one which aims at completeness; and the date of this work

The importance of this MS. consists in a great measure in its marginal
additions, which are very frequent. The text seems to give the original
Bohairic version in a very pure form; while the margin supplies all
or nearly all the passages which in fewer or greater numbers have crept
into the text of other Bohairic MSS., and which (so far as regards the
Bohairic version itself) must be regarded as interpolations</span><a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, whatever
sanction they may have in Greek MSS. or other ancient authorities.
Among these marginal additions I have noted Matt. vi. 13 (the doxology);
Mark vi. 11 ἀμὴν λέγω κ.τ.λ., vii. 16 εἴ τις ἔχει ὦτα κ.τ.λ., xiii. 14 τὸ ῥηθὲν
ὑπὸ Δανιὴλ τοῦ προφήτου, xv. 28 καὶ ἐπληρώθη κ.τ.λ.; Luke i. 28 εὐλογημένη
σὺ ἐν γυναιξίν (in this case, however, not in the margin, but in the text
in a smaller hand); xxii. 43, 44 (the agony); xxiii. 17 ἀνάγκην δὲ εἶχεν
κ.τ.λ.; xxiii. 34; John vii. 53-viii. 11. On the other hand the descent
of the angel, John v. 3, 4, which is wanting in many Bohairic MSS.
and can hardly have been part of the original Bohairic version, stands
in the text here. At the end of St. Mark the margin gives in an ancient
hand (whether coeval with the MS. or not, I am unable to say) the
alternative ending of this Gospel substantially as it is found in L and
other authorities. This marginal note runs as follows: ⲟⲩⲟϩ ⲛⲏ

R. Curzon (afterwards Lord Zouche) from the East, and ever afterwards
belonged to his library. Boetticher's designation therefore is probably
to be explained by a confusion of names. I gather moreover from
private correspondence which I have seen, that some of Mr. Curzon's
Coptic MSS. were in the keeping of Cureton at the British Museum
about the time when Schwartze's collation was made, and this may have
been one. If so, the mistake is doubly explained. I infer the identity
of this MS. with the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">curetonianus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> of Boetticher for the following reasons:
(1) Having made all enquiries, I cannot find that Dr. Cureton ever
possessed a Coptic MS. of the whole or part of the New Testament;
(2) The MS. in question must have been in England, and no other
English MS. satisfies the conditions. My first impression was that
the MS. next described, Parham 121, would prove to be the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">curetonianus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
for I found between the leaves an envelope addressed to Mr. Cureton
at the British Museum, and bearing the post mark, January, 1849; this
fact indicating that it had been in Mr. Cureton's hands about the time
when Schwartze's collation was made. But a comparison of the readings
soon showed that this identification must be abandoned. (3) The cipher
which Boetticher gives for the date is also found in this MS. in two
places, after the Pauline Epistles and again after the Acts. This
coincidence is the more remarkable as the cipher is not very intelligible.
(4) The readings of our MS., Parham 124, where I compared them,
agree with those of Boetticher's </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">curetonianus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, with an occasional exception
which may be accounted for by the inaccuracy of the collation.
This is the case with crucial readings, as for instance the marginal
alternative in Acts vii. 39. At the same time Schwartze's collation,
if Boetticher has given its readings fully, must have been very imperfect.
In a short passage which I collated I found more variations omitted
than there were verses.

From this account of the MSS. it appears that, with the single
exception of the Apocalypse, the Bohairic New Testament, as
far back as we can trace its history, contained all the books
of our present Canon. Nor have I noticed any phenomena in
the language of the several books, which point to any want of
uniformity or separation of date; though it is possible that
a more thorough investigation and a more complete mastery of
the language might reveal such. It seems clear, however, that
the Apocalypse had not a place among the Canonical books.
In the majority of cases it is contained in a separate MS. In
the exceptions which I have investigated, where it is bound up
with other books (the MSS. numbered 1, 12, of the Epistles and
Acts), it is distinguished from them in some marked way; and
probably this will be found to be the case with any which
have not yet been examined. In short, there is not a single
authenticated case of a MS. in which it is treated as of
equal authority with the other Canonical books. Moreover
in Copto-Arabic vocabularies it is omitted from its proper
place at the end of the New Testament, all the other books
being taken in order. This depreciation of the Apocalypse may
perhaps be taken as indicating the date of the completion or
codification of the Bohairic version. The earlier Alexandrian
writers, Clement and Origen, in the first decades of the third
century, quote the Apocalypse without hesitation as the work of
St. John. The later Alexandrian Church also from the close
of the third century onward seems to have had no doubt about
its Apostolic authority (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Westcott, Canon, p. 321). But
about the middle of the third century doubts were entertained
respecting its authorship, to which expression was given by
Dionysius of Alexandria (flor. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 233-265), though even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Dionysius did not deny its canonicity. The difficulty, however,
may have been powerful enough to cause its exclusion from
the Egyptian Canon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The order of the several parts of the New Testament in the
MSS. is (1) Gospels, (2) Pauline Epistles, (3) Catholic Epistles,
(4) Acts. The Gospels occur in their common order. It is
remarkable, however, that in the vocabularies St. John frequently
stands first, so that we get the order, John, Matthew, Mark,
Luke, which (with the doubtful exception of the Sahidic) is
unique. Of this, however, there is no trace in the MSS.; and, as
some of these must carry the tradition further back than the
vocabularies, the arrangement is perhaps to be explained in some
other way. The Pauline Epistles include the Hebrews, which
is placed after 1, 2 Thessalonians and before 1, 2 Timothy<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a>, as in
the Greek MSS. אABC, &amp;c. (see p. <a href="#Pg071" class="tei tei-ref">71</a>). This accords with the
general opinion of the Alexandrian school, which regarded this
Epistle as the work of St. Paul (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Westcott, Canon, p. 323 sq.).
In other respects the familiar order is observed in the Pauline
Epistles, as is also the case with the Catholic Epistles<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bohairic version is for the most part a faithful rendering
of the original, and the Egyptian language which by this
time had borrowed largely from the Greek vocabulary is fairly
adequate for the purpose. This version therefore may generally
be consulted even for minute variations in the text. The connecting
particles are commonly observed; and as the language
has both definite and indefinite articles, it may be employed,
though with some caution, by the textual critic where other
versions fail him. In one point, however, it is quite useless.
When the question lies between a participle and a finite verb in
the construction of a sentence, the looseness of the Egyptian
syntax will seldom afford any clue to the reading which the
translator had before him. Perhaps the weakest point in the
language is the absence of a passive voice, for which the third
person plural active, used impersonally, acts as a substitute.
This produces strange awkwardnesses of expression. Thus
John i. 6 ἀπεσταλμένος παρὰ Θεοῦ is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“whom they sent
from God,”</span> ⲉ ⲁⲩⲟⲩⲟⲣⲡϥ ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲓⲧⲉⲛ ⲫϯ, and i. 17
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

ⲡⲓ ⲛⲟⲙⲟⲥ ⲁⲩⲧⲏⲓϥ ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲓⲧⲉⲛ ⲙⲱⲩⲥⲏⲥ. Another
grave defect is the want of a word corresponding to the simple
meaning of ἔχειν, which has to be rendered by various expedients
according to the context.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the adoption of Greek words there seems to be hardly any
limit but the caprice of the translator. Already in the demotic
writing we find a few of these foreign intruders naturalized;
but in the Coptic, as used for ecclesiastical purposes, they occur
in the greatest profusion. Very frequently their adoption cannot
be explained by any exigencies of translation. Thus for instance
the translator will sometimes render one Greek word by another,
e.g. John xiii. 5, νιπτήρ by λακάνη or λεκάνη; Acts xix. 40,
ἐγκαλεῖν by κατηγορεῖν; xxviii. 17, ἔθος by συνήθεια. Thus again
he will diversify the rendering in the same passage, using
indifferently the Greek and the Egyptian word for the same
original, e.g. ϥⲱⲛⲧ and ⲡⲓⲣⲁⲍⲓⲛ (πειράζειν), Matt. iv. 1, 3;
ϫⲣⲟϫ and ⲥⲡⲉⲣⲙⲁ, John viii. 33, 37; ⲡⲟⲩⲣⲟ and ⲕⲉⲥⲁⲣ
(Καῖσαρ), John xix. 12, 15; ⲓϧ and ⲇⲉⲙⲱⲛ (δαιμόνιον), Matt.
viii. 16, 28, 33. And again and again Greek words are used,
where common Egyptian equivalents were ready to hand. The
conjunctions ἀλλά, δέ, γάρ, οὖν, were doubtless needed to supply
a want in the Egyptian language, which, like the Hebrew and
Aramaic, was singularly deficient in connecting-particles; but
we should hardly have looked for such combinations as ὅμως
μέντοι, πόσῳ μᾶλλον, μήτι, οὐ γάρ, οὐχ ὅτι, ὅτι μὲν γάρ, καί γε, καίτοι,
οὐ μόνον δέ, ἐφ᾽ ὅσον, πῶς οὖν, ἵνα κἄν, ἵνα μήπως, μενοῦνγε, and the
like. Nor should we expect to find Greek terms introduced
with such reckless prodigality as in the following sentences:
John xviii. 3, ⲛⲉⲙ ϩⲁⲛⲫⲁⲛⲟⲥ ⲛⲉⲙ ϧⲁⲛ ⲗⲁⲙⲡⲁⲥ
ⲛⲉⲙ ϩⲱⲛ ϩⲟⲡⲗⲟⲛ; Acts xxiii. 8, ⲙⲙⲟⲛ ⲁⲛⲁⲥⲧⲁⲥⲓⲥ

An opinion which at present seems to prevail largely among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scholars is that of Stern (Z. A. S. 20, 1882, p. 202), who dates it to
the fourth or fifth century, and ascribes it to the literary activity
of the monks of the Natron Lakes. He has further suggested that
it and the Sahidic may both be derived from, or at any rate
connected with, the Akhmîm version (Z. A. S. 24, 1886, p. 134).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last statement may be definitely dismissed; it is based
upon a single sentence quoted from an apocryphal book of the
Old Testament, and is definitely disproved in the case of the New
Testament by a comparison of the two versions. They are not
only different translations, but are based on a different Greek
text. The first statement is apparently based upon language,
and has undoubtedly an element of truth in it. The language
of the version as we have it was probably revised and corrected,
and reduced to a fixed orthography and a more definite form,
but even here it is not possible to speak quite positively, and we
know that there are considerable variations in orthography
preserved in some of the MSS. which may represent the tradition
of different monasteries. But, granting this, it does not by any
means follow that there was not a Bohairic dialect and a Bohairic
version at an earlier date, which is closely represented by this, as
the Akhmim version was represented by the Sahidic, as regards
the Greek text implied. In favour of an early version in the
dialect of Lower Egypt is first the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> argument of the probability
of Christianity spreading earliest in the Delta. We know
that by the middle of the third century it had spread among the
native population of Alexandria (Dion. Al. ap. Eus. <span class="tei tei-q">“H. E.”</span> vi. 41),
and probably had done so in the second century. If Greek had
spread so little in the Delta in the fourth or fifth century as to
make a Bohairic version necessary, it is not likely to have been
more widely prevalent in the third. On these grounds then we
should naturally expect Christianity to spread earliest among the
native populations of the districts round Alexandria, and also
that the New Testament or a portion of it would be translated
very early into their language. Nor again does there seem any
evidence for deriving the Bohairic dialect from the Akhmimish.
It is true that the latter represents the language of Egypt in an
earlier form, but it is not an earlier form of Bohairic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> and negative considerations must be added
the positive argument of Krall (Mitt. i. p. 111). He appears to
have discovered earlier forms of the Bohairic dialect, and in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
addition points out that some of the commonest abbreviations
in Coptic MSS. could only have been derived from the Bohairic,
which seems to show that it was for Bohairic that the alphabet
was first used. And this in the New Testament at any rate is
supported by the text of the version. A study of this has shown
that in the form in which we possess it in most printed editions
and late MSS., although as a whole its agreement with the oldest
Greek MSS. is undoubted, it contains a considerable number of
later additions which agree with the traditional text. But, as
Bishop Lightfoot showed, these clearly formed no part of the
original Bohairic version, and subsequent investigation has made
it clear that the evidence in favour of this statement is even
stronger than he represented it (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Sanday, Appendices ad
Novum Testamentum, App. III. p. 182 sq.). The original
Bohairic text then represents a very pure tradition, untouched
by the so-called Western additions which are found in the
Sahidic version, and it is difficult to believe that a version
so singularly free from these should be later than the Sahidic.
Christianity spread in the Thebaid certainly as early as the
beginning of the third century (Eus. <span class="tei tei-q">“H. E.”</span> vi. 1), and that century
is the period to which internal evidence would assign the origin
of the Sahidic version. An even earlier date is probably
demanded both for the extension of Christianity in the Delta
and for the text of the Bohairic version.]

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Sahidic version did not attract attention till a comparatively
late date. When Wilkins published what was then called
the Coptic New Testament, he mentioned having found among the
Oxford MSS. two which he described as <span class="tei tei-q">“lingua plane a reliquis
MSS. Copticis, quae unquam vidi, diversa”</span> (Praef. p. vii). These
are written in the Thebaic or Sahidic dialect, of which as we may
infer from his language, he did not even know the existence.
After no long time, however, we find La Croze and Jablonski,
with other Egyptian scholars, turning their attention to the
dialect of Upper Egypt: and at length in 1778, C. G. Woide issued
a prospectus in which he announced his intention of publishing
from Oxford MSS. the fragments of the New Testament <span class="tei tei-q">“juxta

some various readings of this version in J. A. Cramer's <span class="tei tei-q">“Beyträge
zur Beförderung theologischer und andrer wichtigen Kenntnisse,”</span>
Pt. iii, Kiel u. Hamburg, 1778. But before Woide's work
appeared he was partially anticipated by other labourers in the
same field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the same year 1778 appeared a grammar of the two
Egyptian dialects by Raphael Tuki, Roman Bishop of Arsinoe,
with the title <span class="tei tei-q">“Rudimenta Linguae Coptae sive Aegyptiacae ad
usum Collegii Urbani de Propaganda Fide, Romae.”</span> It contains
profuse quotations from the Sahidic version of the Old and New
Testaments. This work, which preserves a large number of
passages not to be found elsewhere, has been strangely neglected
by textual critics<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>. Caution, however, must be observed in the
use of it, as the passages are apparently obtained, at least in
many instances, not directly from MSS. of the version itself,
but through the medium of Arabo-Egyptian grammars and
vocabularies; nor is Tuki's work generally at all accurate or
critical<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1785, J. A. Mingarelli published two fasciculi of an account
of the Egyptian MSS. in the Nanian Library under the title
<span class="tei tei-q">“Aegyptiorum codicum reliquiae Venetiis in Bibliotheca Naniana
asservatae, Bononiae.”</span> In these he printed at length two portions
of the Sahidic New Testament, Matt. xviii. 27-xxi. 15, and
John ix. 17-xiii. 1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1789, A. A. Giorgi (Georgius), an Augustinian eremite,
brought out a work entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Fragmentum Evangelii S. Joannis
Graeco-Copto-Thebaicum Saeculi iv. &amp;c., Romae.”</span> This volume
contains John vi. 21-58, and vi. 68-viii. 23, introduced by an
elaborate preface and followed by other matter. The MS. from
which they are taken belonged to the Borgian collection at
Velletri, and has been described already among the Greek MSS.,
p. 141 sq. It is ascribed to the fourth or fifth century.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In the same year, 1789, additional fragments of this version
from other Borgian MSS. were published by F. C. C. H. Münter
in a volume bearing the title, <span class="tei tei-q">“Commentatio de Indole Versionis
Novi Testamenti Sahidicae. Accedunt Fragmenta Epistolarum
Pauli ad Timotheum ex membranis Sahidicis Musei Borgiani
Velitris. Hafniae.”</span> The fragments referred to are 1 Tim. i. 14-iii.
16; vi. 4-21; 2 Tim. i. 1-16. Münter gives also some various
readings of this version in different parts of the four Gospels,
taken likewise from the Borgian MSS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly; in 1790 Mingarelli published a third fasciculus of his
work on the Egyptian MSS. in the Nanian Library, and in it he
printed another important fragment of this version, Mark xi. 29-xv.
32. This third part is very rarely met with, and I have not
seen a copy.

Meanwhile Woide was busily engaged on his edition, and had
already advanced far when his labours were interrupted by death
in May, 1790. His papers were placed in the hands of H. Ford,
Professor of Arabic at Oxford, who after several years completed
the work. It was published with the title, <span class="tei tei-q">“Appendix ad
Editionem Novi Testamenti Graeci e Codice MS. Alexandrino

Testamenti juxta interpretationem Dialecti Superioris Aegypti

Woide's materials were:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Several MSS. of the Huntington collection in the Bodleian.
These consist of (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Two folio lectionaries on paper (Hunt. 3,
Hunt. 5); (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) A folio likewise on paper, containing fragments
of St. John's Gospel (Hunt. 4); (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) An 8vo, containing fragments
of the Acts and Catholic Epistles (Hunt. 394). Woide gives as

A. Mart. 1109 (i.e. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1393) and containing <span class="tei tei-q">“De Mysterio

2. A very ancient papyrus belonging to the famous traveller
Bruce, who had brought it from Upper Egypt. It contains two

3. An ancient vellum MS. containing the Gnostic treatise
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pistis Sophia,”</span> then belonging to Askew and now in the British
Museum. It quotes some passages of the Old and New Testaments.
The <span class="tei tei-q">“Pistis Sophia”</span> has been since transcribed by Schwartze, and
published from his papers by Petermann after his death (1853).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Several fragments belonging to Woide himself, having been
transmitted to him from Upper Egypt while he was employed on
the work. Some are Sahidic; others Graeco-Sahidic. These formed
a highly important accession to his materials. They now belong to
the Clarendon Press at Oxford, and are deposited in the Bodleian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of these, a Graeco-Sahidic MS., said to belong to the fourth
or fifth century, has been already described (Evan. T). But I am
unable to assent to the opinion which is maintained by Tregelles
and Tischendorf, and in which Dr. Scrivener there acquiesces,
that these Woidian fragments (T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">s</span></span> or T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">woi</span></span>) were originally part
of the same MS. with the Borgian Graeco-Sahidic fragments (T)
published by Giorgi. And this for two reasons. (1) The paging
of the two sets of fragments is quite inconsistent. The Woidian
fragments, Luke xii. 5 (Sahid. Gr. 15)-xiii. 23 (Sahid. Gr. 32)
and John viii. 22-32, are paged ⲩⲛⲑ-ⲩⲡⲇ (459-484) and ⲭⲛⲍ,
ⲭⲛⲏ (657, 658) respectively (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Ford's <span class="tei tei-q">“Praef.,”</span> p. 24). On
the other hand the pages of the Borgian fragments, Luke
xxii. 12-xxiii. 11; John vi. 21-58; vi. 68-viii. 23, are
numbered ⲥⲗⲑ-ⲥⲛⲇ (239-254), ⲧⲗⲇ-ⲧⲙⲅ, ⲧⲙⲝ-ⲧⲝⲁ
(334-343, 346-361) respectively (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Zoega, p. 184; Georgius,
p. 11 sq.). (2) Though the last Woidian fragment begins <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">somewhere
about</span></em> where the last Borgian fragment ends, it does not
begin at exactly the same place. The Borgian fragment ends
ⲁⲛⲅ ⲁⲛⲟⲕ ⲟⲩ ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲛ ⲧⲡⲉ ⲛⲧⲱⲧⲛ ⲛⲧⲉ (ἐγὼ ἐκ τῶν ἄνω
εἰμί; ὑμεῖς), viii. 23; the Woidian fragment begins ⲉ ϯⲛⲁⲃⲱⲕ
ⲉⲣⲟϥ (ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω), viii. 22. Thus the two have several
lines in common. For these reasons the later judgement of
Tregelles, who pronounces them to be <span class="tei tei-q">“certainly parts of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same</span></em> MS.”</span> (Introductory notice to his G. T.), must be abandoned;
and we must revert to his earlier and more cautious opinion in
which he describes the Woidian fragment as <span class="tei tei-q">“a portion of a MS.
almost a counterpart of T”</span> (Horne's <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction,”</span> p. 180).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. A Sahidic vocabulary in the Royal Library at Paris (Copt. 44),
containing several passages from the Sahidic Bible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. A few fragments communicated by Adler from the collection
of Card. Borgia at Velletri. Besides these Woide incorporated
the fragments published by Mingarelli in his first two fasciculi.
The works of Giorgi and Münter, however, and the third fasciculus
of Mingarelli, were overlooked by him or by his successor
Ford.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides elaborate prefaces by Ford and Woide this work gives
a Latin translation in parallel columns with the Sahidic. It
would not be difficult to point out numerous errors in the execution
of this volume; but all allowance must be made for
a posthumous work completed by a second editor who had
to educate himself for the task, and the heavy obligation under
which Woide and Ford have laid Biblical scholars may well
silence ill-natured criticism<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some years later appeared a highly important contribution to
Sahidic literature in G. Zoega's <span class="tei tei-q">“Catalogus Codicum Copticorum
manuscriptorum qui in Museo Borgiano Velitris adservantur,
Romae, 1810,”</span> a posthumous work. The compiler of this catalogue
prints at length Eph. v. 21-33; Apoc. xix. 7-18; xx. 7-xxi. 3,
and gives besides (p. 200) a full list of the fragments of the
Sahidic version, which are found in this rich collection of
Egyptian MSS. These would go far towards filling up the gaps
in Woide's edition. Thus, for instance, they contain about three-quarters
of St. Mark's Gospel, the whole of the Epistle to the
Ephesians, and the whole of the Epistle to the Philippians
with the exception of five or six verses at the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the following year (1811) appeared Engelbreth's work on
the Bashmuric version, which has been mentioned above (p. 102).
In it he printed, for the sake of comparison with the Bashmuric,
the following passages of the Sahidic version: 1 Cor. i. 1-16;
xv. 5-33; Phil. i. 7-23; 1 Thess. i. 4-iii. 5; Heb. vii. 11-13;
16-21; ix. 2-10; 24-28; x. 5-10. These were derived wholly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the Borgian MSS., with the exception of a few verses taken
from Woide's book. Beyond this meagre contribution of Engelbreth's,
nothing has been done during more than sixty years
which have elapsed since the appearance of Zoega's work
towards the publication of these valuable remains, important
alike for the knowledge of the Egyptian language and for
purposes of Biblical criticism. A complete collection of all the
fragments of the Sahidic New Testament is now the most
pressing want in the province of textual criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The materials for such an edition are the following:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The MSS. used by Woide and Ford, which however will require
collating afresh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Nanian fragments published by Mingarelli. The MSS. which
he used are said to have disappeared.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The MSS. of the Borgian collection, as indicated in the catalogue
of Zoega. After the dispersion of the museum at Velletri the Biblical
MSS. found their way to the Library of the Propaganda at Rome, where
they now are.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The quotations in Tuki, though for reasons already stated these must
be used with caution. They should be traced, if possible, to their sources.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these known materials the following, which (so far as I am
aware), have never been publicly noticed, must be added:
</p>

1. *British Museum, Papyrus xiii, four leaves or eight pages numbered
ⲋⲙⲁ-ⲋⲙⲏ, containing John xx. 1-29 mutilated. It does not differ
in any important respects from the text printed by Woide, but I noticed
the following variations: ver. 3, Σίμων Πέτρος; ver. 8, add οὖν after τότε;

Of these four fragments ii and iv are the most ancient; while
i and iii are much later, but still old. Beyond this I do not venture
to hazard an opinion as to their date, remembering that Zoega with all
his knowledge and experience declines to pronounce on the age of undated
Egyptian MSS.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>

4*. A fragment (a single leaf) of a Graeco-Sahidic lectionary in
double columns, belonging to the Rev. G. Horner, who brought it from
Upper Egypt in 1873 [ix], 12-1/4 × 11. The Greek and Sahidic are not
in opposite columns, but the Greek is followed by the Sahidic. The
Greek is Matt. iv. 2-11 τεσσεράκοντα καὶ τεσσεράκοντα νύκτας ... διηκόνουν
αὐτῷ; the Sahidic is iv. 1-6 Τότε ... ἐπὶ χειρῶν ἀροῦσί σε. The Coptic
character resembles classes v and vi in Zoega. The Greek text has
been already numbered as Evst. 299. This has now been presented to
the Bodleian by Mr. Horner, MS. Gr. Lit. c. 1.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The Biblical MSS. of the Borgian collection preserved in the
Library of the Propaganda have been published by M. Amélineau. The
Old Testament in the Recueil des Travaux, the New Testament in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Zeitschrift für Aegyptische Sprache,”</span> 24 (1886), pp. 41, 103; 25 (1887),
pp. 47, 100, 125; 26 (1888), p. 96. This publication was made under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
considerable disadvantages. M. Amélineau had not the opportunity
of seeing the MSS. himself, and merely published a transcript supplied
him by the Coptic Archbishop Bschai, then resident in Rome. Moreover
he gives no critical notes on various readings in cases where there is
more than one copy extant of any passage. Nor again does he edit the
fragments completely, but only such portions of the New Testament as
were not previously known. His edition therefore is not without
inaccuracies, which have been noticed by Ciasca, vol. ii. pp. lix-lxxvii.
These defects are, however, being remedied by an edition of all these
fragments by Father Ciasca (known as the editor of the Arabic Diatessaron),
which is very complete. The first two volumes, containing the
Old Testament with many facsimiles, have appeared: the New Testament
portion is to follow. (Sacrorum Bibliorum Fragmenta Copto-Sahidica

5. But most important of all are the newly acquired fragments of the
Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. In 1883 that Library had the good
fortune to obtain (largely through the influence of M. Amélineau) from
the famous White Monastery or Deir Amba Shenoudah of Upper Egypt
a large collection of Sahidic fragments. The publication of these has
been begun. Considerable sections of the Old Testament have been
published by Maspero (Mémoires, vol. vi), and of documents relating to
Early Church History by Bouriant (ib. vol. viii). The New Testament
fragments have not yet been published, but M. Amélineau, who is
entrusted with them, has kindly put at my disposal the following list of

From the above account it becomes clear that we have now
already published, or preserved in European libraries, enough
material to produce a complete or almost a complete edition of
the Sahidic New Testament. But not only this. We have also
a considerable number of fragments written on papyrus, which
are much older than any of the MSS. previously known, and
will enable us to write a history of the version from an early
date. May we express a hope that M. Amélineau, who has made
large collections for the purpose, would first of all give us an
edition of the Paris fragments as accurate as that of Ciasca, and
then of the Sahidic New Testament as a whole? Much more
than when Bishop Lightfoot wrote is the publication of it the
pressing need of Biblical criticism.]
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The order of the books in the Sahidic New Testament, so
far as regards the great groups, appears to have been the same
as in the Bohairic, i.e. (1) The Four Gospels, (2) The Pauline
Epistles, (3) The Catholic Epistles and Acts (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> above, p. <a href="#Pg124" class="tei tei-ref">124</a>).
This may be inferred from the order of quotations in the
Sahidic vocabulary described by Woide, Praef., p. 18; for the
Sahidic MSS. are so fragmentary that no inference on this point
can be drawn from them. Like the Bohairic, the original
Sahidic Canon seems to have excluded the Apocalypse. In
the vocabulary just mentioned it does not appear as part of
the New Testament, but liturgical and other matter interposes
before it is taken. Moreover in most cases it is evident from
the paging of the fragments which remain that the MSS.
containing this book formed separate volumes. In the Paris
fragment described above this is plainly the case, and it is
equally obvious in the Borgian MSS. lxxxviii, lxxxix (Zoega,
p. 187). Thus in lxxxviii, pp. 39-44 contain Apoc. xii. 14-xiv.
13; and in lxxxix. pp. 59, 60, 63, 64 contain Apoc. xix. 7-18,
xx. 7-xxi. 3. On the other hand in lxxxvii. where Apoc. iii.
20 begins on p. 279, this fragment must have formed part of
a much larger volume, which contained (as we may suppose)
a considerable portion of the New Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The order of the four Gospels presents a difficulty. In the
Sahidic vocabulary already referred to, the sequence is John,
Matthew, Mark, Luke; and this order is also observed in
the marginal concordance to the Crawford and Balcarres MS.
described above. Thus there is reason for supposing that at one
time St. John stood first. But the paging of the oldest MSS.
does not favour this conclusion. In the Woidian and Borgian
fragments of the Graeco-Sahidic Gospels, which belong to the
fourth or fifth century, the numbering of the pages (see p. <a href="#Pg130" class="tei tei-ref">130</a>)
shows that St. Luke stood before St. John. It is possible indeed
that in the MSS. the transcriber was guided by the usual
Greek arrangement. But in other MSS. also the synoptic evangelists
precede St. John, e.g. Borg. xlvi, l, lxiv; while in other
fragments again (Borg. lxx, lxxiv) the high numbers of the pages of
St. John show that the Evangelist cannot have stood first in the
volume, and this seems further supported by the Paris fragments,
in which we find St. John following St. Luke in the same MS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this version, as in the Bohairic, the Epistle to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hebrews was treated as the work of St. Paul; but instead
of being placed, as there, after 2 Thessalonians and before
1 Timothy, it stood between 2 Corinthians and Galatians<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>. It
clearly occupies this position in the Borgian MS. lxxx (Zoega,
p. 186): and by calculating the pages I have ascertained that
this must also have been its place in all the other MSS. of
the Pauline Epistles of which fragments after 2 Corinthians are
preserved. These are the Borgian fragments lxxxii, lxxxv, lxxxvi,
(Zoega, p. 186 sq.), and the Crawford and Balcarres fragment (iv)
described above (p. <a href="#Pg132" class="tei tei-ref">132</a>); all of which happily are paged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Oxford MS. Hunt. 394 is a proof that the Acts followed the
Catholic Epistles in the Sahidic New Testament, as is the case also
in the Memphitic. Woide indeed (Praef., p. 22), when describing
this MS., says, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exorditur</span></em> ab Actis Apostolicis”</span>; but, even if this
be so, his own account of the paging shows that the leaves have
been displaced in binding, and that the Catholic Epistles originally
stood first. The vocabulary also places them before the Acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Sahidic version appears to be in one respect less faithful
to the original than the Bohairic. So far as I am able to
judge, it pays more respect to the Egyptian idiom, frequently
omitting the conjunction and leaving the sentences disconnected.
As regards the vocabulary, it adopts Greek words with as great
facility as the Bohairic, or even greater. This we should
hardly anticipate in Upper Egypt, which must have been comparatively
free from Greek influence. Altogether it is a rougher
and less polished version than the Bohairic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The real textual value of the Sahidic cannot under present
circumstances be assigned with any certainty. What would be
received by one school of critics would not be admitted by another.
But the Editor readily records the verdict of Bishop Lightfoot that
the text of it, though very ancient, is inferior to the Bohairic, and
less pure; that it exhibits a certain infusion of readings which
were widely spread in the second century, and may very probably
have had, to a considerable extent, a Western origin; that it
differs very largely from the Traditional text; and that both in text
and in interpretation it is entirely independent of the Bohairic.
The coincidences are not greater than must have been exhibited
by two separate translations in allied dialects from independent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
texts of the same original. Of any mutual influence of the versions
of Upper and Lower Egypt on each other no traces are discernible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following passage from Acts xvii. 12-16 will serve to
illustrate the independence of these two versions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
[The history of the discovery of the third Egyptian version, and
the reasons that have caused it to be assigned to the district of
the Fayoum, have been given above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Fayoum (ⲫⲓⲟⲙ: ⲡⲓⲟⲙ: ⲡⲓⲁⲙ) is a district of
Egypt situated to the west of the Nile valley, from which it is
separated by a narrow strip of desert, and lying about eighty
miles to the south of the apex of the Delta. It is a large
depression in the desert, which has been reclaimed and fertilized
by an offshoot of the Nile, now called the Bahr-il-Yousouf, and
is distinguished at the present day for its extreme fertility.
It appears to have been particularly prosperous and thickly
populated in Ptolemaic and Roman times; and in the desert
surrounding the cultivated land are the remains of several
Greek cities, and of large Coptic monasteries; and it is from
here that the chief part of the collection of papyrus fragments
now in Berlin and Vienna have been obtained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dialect of this district, both in the fragments of the
Scriptures preserved in it, and in the other documents more
recently discovered (Z. A. S. 23, 1885, p. 26), presents very
marked peculiarities. As regards vowels it shows the following
amongst other variations as compared with Sahidic. It substitutes
ⲁ for ⲉ: ⲛⲉⲕ for ⲛⲁⲕ; ⲗⲉⲛ for ⲣⲁⲛ; ⲕⲉⲉⲃ for
ⲭⲁϥ : ⲕⲁⲁϥ; ⲏ for ⲉ: ⲥⲏⲛⲧⲓ for ⲥⲉⲛϯ : ⲥⲛⲧⲉ; ⲏⲙⲓ
for ⲉⲙⲓ : ⲉⲓⲙⲉ; ⲁ for ⲟ: ⲃⲁⲗ for ⲉⲃⲟⲗ; ⲗⲁⲃ for ⲉⲣⲟϥ;
ⲟ for ⲱ: ϩⲟⲃ for ϩⲱⲃ; ⲗⲟⲙⲓ for ⲗⲱⲙⲓ (= ⲡⲱⲙⲓ :
ⲣⲱⲙⲉ). In consonants it has two very marked features, the
substitution of ⲗ for ⲣ, as ⲉⲗ, ⲉⲗⲉ, ⲗⲉⲡ; ϣⲏⲗⲓ for ⲉⲣ, ⲉⲣⲉ,
&amp;c., and of ⲃ for final ϥ, as ⲛⲧⲁⲃ for ⲛⲧⲟϥ.

On this version Bishop Lightfoot wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“As the Bashmuric
is a secondary version, it has no independent value, and is only
useful in passages where the Sahidic is wanting.”</span> This opinion
would hardly represent the present position. That the Sahidic
and Fayoum versions are not independent is quite true, but the
relation of them to one another is much more that they are
different forms of the same version, of which on the whole
perhaps the Fayoum represents the older and more primitive
text.]

[It has already been explained that documents found on the

any of those that we have yet considered. In this also fragments
have been found of a translation of the New Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dialect shows a combination of Sahidic and Bohairic forms.
It has ⲓⲱⲧ for Sah. ⲉⲓⲱⲧ; ⲙⲉⲧⲓⲱⲧ for ⲙⲛⲧⲉⲓⲱⲧ;
ⲓⲱⲁⲛⲏⲥ for ⲓⲱϩⲁⲛⲛⲏⲥ; ⲛⲧⲟⲧⲕ for ⲛⲧⲟⲟⲧⲕ; ϣⲧⲱⲣⲓ
for ϣⲧⲱⲣⲉ. It agrees again with the Fayoum dialect (which
is generally considered a variety of it) in its affection for ⲁ, as
ⲛⲧⲁⲕ for ⲛⲧⲟⲕ, and apparently in using ⲗ for ⲣ, but only
occasionally.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following specimen from Rom. xi. 31-36 will exhibit the
character of the dialect and the version: the Sahidic is taken
from the Borgian fragment published by Amélineau, Z. A. S. 25,
1887, p. 49; the Middle Egyptian from <span class="tei tei-q">“Mittheilungen,”</span> ii. p. 69.

affinities are nearest to the Middle Egyptian; it has ⲁ for ⲟ,
ⲁⲩ for ⲟⲟⲩ, and ⲉ for ⲁ. It does not use ⲗ for ⲣ. Like
the Sahidic it has double vowel-endings, and the weak final ⲉ,
but not ⲫ, ⲑ, ⲭ for ⲡϩ, ⲧϩ, ⲕϩ. It also has some Bohairic
forms, such as ⲛⲟⲩ, ⲁⲣⲉ, ⲁϥ. In the vowels it has the
following peculiarities: ⲁ for ⲉ (Sah.), ⲁϩⲟⲩⲛ, ⲁϩⲣⲏⲓ,
ⲁⲣⲁⲕ, ⲁⲃⲁⲗ; ⲓ or ⲉⲓ for ⲏ, ⲡⲓ (sun), ⲥⲙⲉⲓ, ⲧϩⲉⲓ; ⲟⲩ for
ⲱ, ⲕⲟⲩ, ϫⲟⲩ, ⲥⲃⲟⲩ; ⲟ for ⲁⲩ, ⲛⲟ, ⲥⲛⲟ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But its most distinguishing feature is an entirely new letter,
[Symbol: Coptic <span class="tei tei-q">“hori”</span> glyph with additional stroke to lower left]:
this may represent ϣ of other dialects; [Symbol: the new glyph] for ⲉϣ (to
know), ⲉϩ [with the new glyph] for ⲁϣ; or ϫ as ⲧϩⲡⲟ [with the new glyph] for ϫⲡⲟ; or ϧ : ϩ, as
ⲱⲛϩ [with the new glyph] for ⲱⲛϧ; ⲥϩⲉⲓ [with the new glyph] for ⲥϧⲁⲓ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The textual affinities can hardly be worked out with the small
amount of material we possess, but there seems to be little doubt
that it represents in a very early form the same version that
we are acquainted with in Sahidic. Further discoveries in this
dialect may do much to make us acquainted with the early
history of the version of Upper Egypt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Only two short fragments of this version are known, which
have been edited by Mr. W. E. Crum in his edition of the Coptic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
MSS. brought from the Fayoum by W. M. Flinders Petrie (p. 2).
They are contained in a parchment MS. of very great antiquity
(Mr. Crum suggests the fourth century, but this is certainly too
early), and contain St. James iv. 12-13, St. Jude 17-20. The
following comparison of it with the Sahidic will show both the
similarity of the versions and the differences of the dialect.

It has only been possible in the above account to give
a rough outline of more recent discovery. Further investigation
is necessary, and the lines which divide the different dialects,
especially those between Fayoumic and Middle Egyptian, require
to be more accurately defined. Much may be hoped also from
the results of future discovery. The rubbish heaps of the
monasteries, the concealed libraries, the graves, have yielded up
some of their treasures, but all has not yet been brought to light.
Enough has been written to suggest that discoveries of great
interest for the life and character of early Egyptian Christianity
have been made, and that much still remains to be found, which
may indirectly throw a flood of light on the early history of

The remaining Versions are of less importance in the ascertainment
of the sacred text. But some of them have recently
received more attention in the general widening of research,
and in becoming better known have strengthened their claims to
recognition and value. Three of them, at all events, date from
the period of the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament now
known to be in existence. And the presence amongst us of
eminent scholars acquainted with them renders reference to them
more easy than it was a few years ago.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless, some are of slight service to the critic, being
secondary versions, and as such becoming handmaids, not of
the Greek, but of some other version translated from the Greek.

a dialect of the great Teutonic stock of languages, having
previously invented or adapted an alphabet expressly for their

siege of Prague in 1648. Queen Christina gave it to her librarian,
Isaac Vossius, and from him it was very rightly purchased about 1662

Luke, Mark) on 187 leaves, 4to (out of 330), of purple vellum; the bold,
uncial, Gothic letters being in silver, sometimes in gold, of course much

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The existing Armenian version is a recension made shortly
after the Council of Ephesus of a still earlier version, which was
based in part upon a Syriac, in part upon a Greek original. This
latest recension was made according to <span class="tei tei-q">“accurate and reliable
copies”</span> of the Greek Bible, which, along with the Canons of the
Council of Ephesus, were brought from Constantinople about the
year 433. One would naturally wish for more details than the
above brief statement contains; yet it is all that one can
definitely infer from the history of the version as related by
three nearly contemporary writers, whose accounts we now subjoin,
namely, Koriun, Lazar of Pharpi, and Moses Khorenatzi.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Koriun<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> in his life of St. Mesrop (written between 441 and 452
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) relates as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the fifth year of the reign of Vramshapho [i.e. about
397 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>], St. Mesrop was first in Edessa, then in Amid, lastly in
Samosata, busy all the time about his discovery of the Armenian
characters<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a>. In Samosata, where he was received with great
respect by the clergy and bishop, Mesrop met with a Greek
scribe, Hrofanos (? Rufinus), in conjunction with whom, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the help of two pupils named John and Joseph, he
undertook a translation of the Bible. They began—and this is
noteworthy—with the book of the Proverbs of Solomon; Hrofanos
or Rufinus writing down the translation with his own hand.
Mesrop next visited the Bishop of the Syrians, who congratulated
him on his work. He then returned to Nor Chalach, or new
city, as Valarshapat was called by the Romans, in the sixth
year of Vramshapho's reign, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 398. At a later time, Koriun,
the writer, was himself sent with Eznik to Constantinople,
apparently in quest of books to translate; for they returned
with a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sure</span></em> copy of the Scriptures, with works of the Fathers,
and with the canons of the Councils of Nice and Ephesus.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now St. Sahak had long before translated the collection of
Church books from Greek into Armenian, as well as much true
wisdom of the holy Patriarchs. But he now resumed, and
taking with the help of Eznik the former translations made
hurriedly and offhand, he confirmed them by the help of the
true copies now brought, and they translated much commentary
on the books.”</span> The above is the gist of what Koriun has to tell
us, though he mentions that scholars were sent to Edessa to
translate and bring back the works of the Fathers. Why
Mesrop began with the Book of Proverbs, whether he translated
more than that, and from which language, we do not learn from
Koriun. Lazar of Pharpi<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>, who wrote in the last half of the
sixth century, is our next authority. He states that up to the
last decade of the fourth century, the offices of religion were
still read in Greater Armenia in Syriac, a language which the
people did not understand. The edicts of the kings of Armenia
were also written out in Syriac or Greek characters. But as
soon as the Armenian alphabet was discovered, St. Sahak—who
was patriarch 390-428 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> and an expert in Greek—set himself,
in response to the patriotic exhortations of St. Mesrop, of Vramshapho
the king, and of the clergy and nobles, to translate the
Holy Scriptures. He states that St. Sahak's version comprised
the whole of the Old and New Testaments, and was made from

Moses of Chorene, bk. iii. ch. 36 ff., copies, confuses, and adds
to Koriun's account. A little before 370 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> the Persians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
overran Armenia, and Meroujah, their leader, burned all the
books he could find in the country, proscribed the study of the
Greek language, and enacted penalties against any who should
speak it or translate from it. At that time, adds Moses, the
offices of the church were performed in Greek, because the
Armenian alphabet did not yet exist. On the death of Theodosius
(Jan. 395 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) there was a partition of Armenia between his
successor Arcadius and the king of Persia, by which the latter took
undisputed possession of the eastern provinces, including the basin
of Ararat, in which lay the new religious centre Valarshapat or
Edschmiadzin, the νέα πόλις of the Romans. The new Mesropic
alphabet was at first used only in Persian Armenia; for, says
Moses, in the parts dependent on the Greeks, all writing had to
be in Greek characters, Syriac being forbidden. As soon as
Mesrop had elaborated his alphabet with the aid of Hrophanos,
he betook himself to the work of translation; and with the aid
of his pupils John and Joseph, translated the entire twenty-two
authentic books along with the New Testament, taking care to
begin with the Book of Proverbs. About the year 406 he returned
to Armenia, and found St. Sahak engaged in translating the
Syriac Bible. He hints that Sahak would have preferred
a Greek original, if Meroujah had not burned all the Greek
books nearly thirty years before. This perhaps implies that the
version, on which Mesrop had been engaged in Samosata, was
made from Greek. Nor is that unlikely; for Rufinus, who
helped him, was a Greek, and we learn from Koriun that there
were Armenians in Edessa studying both Greek and Syriac.
We read in bk. iii. ch. 60 of the History of Moses, about
missions sent to Edessa and Byzantium in order to the translation
of the works of the Fathers, but we hear nothing more
expressly touching the Version of the Bible, save this, that
after the Council of Ephesus, Sahak and Mesrop, then in Ashtishat
in Taron, received from Byzantium, as aforesaid, the
canons of the council recently held, along with accurate copies
of the Greek Bible. On receipt of these, Sahak and Mesrop
translated afresh what had already been translated, and were
zealous in recasting the text. But they were not, it seems, after
all, satisfied with their work, and sent Moses to Alexandria to
learn the <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful tongue”</span> (i.e. Greek), with a view to a more
accurate articulation and division (of the Armenian scriptures).
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The above summary exhausts the evidence of Moses of Khorene<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a>.
It would appear therefrom that the Bible was translated
twice into Armenian before the end of the fourth century; by
Mesrop from Greek, and by Sahak from Syriac. The circumstance
that Mesrop in Samosata began with the Proverbs of
Solomon raises a suspicion that the earlier books had already
been rendered, when and by whom is unknown. Certainly the
reasons given by Koriun and by Moses for Mesrop beginning
with Proverbs are insufficient. Moses again in stating that
Sahak rendered the entire Bible from Syriac contradicts both
Koriun and Lazar. Are we to infer that Sahak and Mesrop after
430 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> retranslated according to the Constantinople Bibles
what they had already translated from Syriac, and also it would
seem from a presumably less perfect Greek text? Anyhow it is
unlikely that they would wholly sacrifice their own work, and
we should therefore expect to find in the Armenian version
a mixture of texts, namely of some old Syriac text, which must
have been in vogue as late as 380, of some older Greek text
supplied in Edessa or Samosata, and of the Constantinopolitan
texts; which last may well have been among the fifty splendid
copies which had been prepared under the order of Constantine
by Eusebius a century before. If, and how far, these different
elements enter into the Version can only be determined by
a careful analysis of its readings. It may be that in some MSS.
there lurks more of the unrevised text than in others<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>. The
entire history is an apt illustration of that political see-saw
between the Roman and the Persian powers which went on in
Armenia during the fourth and fifth centuries, and out of which
the patriotic vigour and devotion of St. Mesrop and St. Sahak
carved at last a truly national Armenian Church, with an
independent life and literature of its own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Armenian Version was collated for Robert Holmes' edition
of the Septuagint, though not with desirable accuracy nor from
the oldest MSS. For example, the Codex Arm. 3 of the Pentateuch,
which Holmes declares, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">teste Adlero</span></span>, to be of the year 1063,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is but an eighteenth century codex. The collation of the New
Testament in the eighth edition of Tischendorf's N. T. is accurate
so far as it goes, but is far from being exhaustive or based on a consensus
of the oldest MSS. Old codices of the Armenian Gospels
are very common, and the present writer knows of as many as
eight, none of them later than the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1000; of four of
these he has complete collations. The rest of the N. T. is only
found in codices of the whole Bible, which are rare and always
written in minuscules, never in uncials as are the Gospels. He
knows of no copies of the whole Bible older than the twelfth
century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two further questions call for brief answer:—1. Have we the
Armenian version as it left the hands of the fifth century translators
2. Did the fifth century version comprise the whole of
the Old and New Testament?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In regard to the first question, it must be admitted as probable
that changes were subsequently made, at least in the New
Testament, in the way both of omission and addition; e.g. in
St. Luke xxii. 44, out of four very early uncial codices collated
by the writer, the words: ἐγένετο δὲ ὁ ἱδρῶς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ
θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπι τὴν γῆν, are found only in one,
and that one the earliest, being dated 902 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> The words which
precede ὤφθη δ—ὲπροσηύχετο are omitted in all four of them. We
may infer that ver. 44 was in the original version, and was omitted
from the three codices for doctrinal reasons. The additions
made to the text after the fifth century are easier to detect;
because they only come in some MSS. and not in others, and
also because there is so much discrepancy of readings between
those codices which add them, that they are at once seen to be
lacunas supplied by different hands. This is the case, for
example, with the end of St. Mark's Gospel, which only comes in
one of the four codices mentioned, namely in the oldest
Edschmiadzin Codex, under the heading <span class="tei tei-q">“of the Elder Ariston,”</span>
which may refer to Aristion, teacher of Papias, or to Ariston of
Pella. The case is the same with the episode of the woman
taken in adultery. For the settlement of such points there
is wanted a careful collation of the oldest codices.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In answer to the other question we may state, without entering
into the proof of it, that the fifth century version included
all the books of the Old and New Testament save the third book
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Ezra, Esther, Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, and perhaps
the Maccabees. For as we read in Elisaeus that Vartan Mamikonean
in the middle of the fifth century inspired his troops to
deeds of valour against the Persians by reading to them the
Book of Maccabees, we may fairly infer that that also was
already then rendered. It may be added that the Psalms were
rendered for church use prior to the rest of the Bible, and were
translated afresh by Mesrop and his disciples; also that the
Book of Revelations was translated twice. The double translation
of both these books is a fact which can be traced in various
MSS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One other point must be noticed. From the history of Moses
of Chorene, it is not clear what were the imperfections of the
Armenian version, to remedy which Moses was sent to Alexandria.
We cannot suppose that Mesrop and Sahak and Eznik, and the
other doctors who had already translated the Greek codices
brought from Byzantium, were incompetent Greek scholars.
The object therefore of Moses' voyage to Alexandria was probably
that he might add to the Armenian text the Sections of Ammonius,
and also the asterisks and obeli of Origen's Hexaplaric
copy<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>. The Ammonian Sections are found in all Armenian New
Testaments, and in some copies of the Bible the Origenian marks
as well; for instance, in Codex 3270 of the Bibliotheca Vindobonensis.
There is no evidence that the Armenians ever used
a version of Tatian's Diatessaron.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Ethiopic translation of the Bible is assigned by Guidi to
the end of the fifth, or beginning of the sixth century, the time
at which Christianity became the dominant religion in Abyssinia.
That religion after a period of decadence began to flourish again
in the twelfth century, but in dependence on the Patriarchate of
Alexandria. The two principal classes of Ethiopic Biblical MSS.
are connected with these periods respectively; the first class
being derived from the Greek text before, and the latter
after the Alexandrian recension. The corrections, however, vary
in different copies, and appear to be the result of desultory rather
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than of systematic alteration. The MSS. of the Ethiopic N. T.
are rarely complete; ordinarily the Gospels, the Epistles of
St. Paul, and the Catholic Epistles with the Acts and the
Apocalypse constitute separate volumes. The oldest copy of the
Gospels would seem to be no. 32 of the Bibliothèque Nationale in
Paris, written in the reign of Yekūnō Amlāk; whereas MS. 33
of the same collection represents the later text. Examples of
the different recensions are given by Guidi, Atti della R.

whom most of the above statements are taken.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Church of the Iberians was founded during the reign of
Constantine according to tradition; though, if we consider how
intimate and frequent had been from a much earlier period their
intercourse with the Greeks, we may safely infer that the seeds
of Christianity had been long before sown among them. There
is no certain evidence of the date at which they translated the
Scriptures; but it is probable that their version of the New
Testament was made in the fifth and sixth centuries; and that it
was made from a Greek text the most perfunctory examination
suffices to prove. According to Armenian historians of the fifth
century, St. Mesrop, at the same time that he invented the
Armenian characters and made the Armenian version for his own
countrymen, fulfilled the same service for the Georgians also. In
this tradition, however, the Georgians do not concur; and, no
doubt, rightly, seeing that their ancient alphabet and their version
are alike independent of the Armenian. It is said by some native
Georgian scholars that before the tenth century a revision was
made of their version, in order to make it more complete.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present writer knows of no manuscript of the entire Bible
in Europe except at Mount Athos, where there is one reputed to
be of the tenth century. Others are preserved in the Convents
of the Holy Cross at Jerusalem, and of Mount Sinai. In the
Vatican Library there is a codex of the New Testament, neatly
written on parchment in majuscule, parts of which the present
writer has collated with the printed text. This codex is at least
as old as the thirteenth century, and in the collations below is
referred to as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>. Beside this codex the writer has examined in
the Georgian Library at Tiflis three very ancient codices of the
Gospels, written in uncials on parchment. These books were
smaller in size than are, as a rule, the copies of the Gospels used
in Eastern Churches.

The Bible was not printed in Georgian until the year 1743 at
Moscow in large folio. It is a rare volume, and has never been
reprinted. The character is that called ecclesiastical or priestly
majuscule, which differs wholly from the civil characters and can,
as a rule, be read by the priests only. The New Testament and
Psalms have been reprinted at various times from this original
edition, both in priestly and civil characters, and of the latter
kind very good and cheap copies can be obtained at the British
and Foreign Bible Society, printed, however, at Tiflis. It is said
that the edition of 1743 was conformed to the Slavonic version
of the Bible; and if this were true, it would, of course, impair
its value for critical purposes. Of this statement, however, the
writer's collations, so far as they go, afford no proof. Such
variations as there are between the printed edition and the
manuscript texts are notified in these collations. The point,
however, could easily be settled by a thorough comparison of
the printed text with the Slavonic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The MSS. of Tiflis include the last verses of Mark, and the
Vatican MS. contains the narrative of the woman taken in
adultery, but places it after ver. 44, instead of after ver. 52 of
the seventh chapter of John. The printed edition places it after
ver. 52, and this uncertainty as to where to insert the narrative,
in itself indicates that it is a later interpolation. The printed
text also contains the text about the three witnesses; but it is
pieced into the context in an awkward and ungrammatical
way; and whether it is in any MS. the writer cannot say. The
following all too brief collations prove that the printed text fairly
represents the MSS.; from which, indeed, it differs very little
except in its more modern orthography. It is certain, however,
that the most ancient MSS. of this version must be collated and
a critical text of it prepared, before it can be quite reliably used
as an early witness to the Greek text in regard to any particular
points. Where the earliest Greek authorities waver as to the
particles by which the parts of the narrative shall be connected—some,
e.g. giving καί, others δέ, others οὖν—the Georgian
constantly passes abruptly to the new matter without any
connecting particle at all—and this, although as a language
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Georgian is richer in such connecting particles than is Greek.
This peculiarity of the version, which is also shared by the old
Armenian version, seems to prove that it was made from
a primitive text, in which editors had not yet begun to smooth
away the sudden transitions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This version of the Bible is ascribed to Cyril and Methodius,
who lived at the end of the ninth century. It is uncertain,
however, how much of the New Testament was translated at
that date, and how much was the work of a later time. The
manuscripts of the version exist in two characters called Glagolitic
and Cyrillic: of these it is now generally agreed that the
former is the earlier. In considering the version from the point
of view of the textual criticism of the New Testament, we need
not deal with its later history except in so far as that throws
light on its original form. The chief points to which reference
will be made will be (i) the different Manuscripts in which the
version exists, with their distinctive characteristics, and the
evidence they afford as to the earliest form—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Urtext</span></span>—of the
version, and (ii) the Greek text presupposed by the version in the
form in which we have it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be convenient to divide the New Testament into three
component parts, (i) the Gospels, (ii) the Acts and Epistles, or
the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostol</span></span> as it is called in Slavonic, (iii) the Apocalypse.
There can be little doubt that the Gospels were the earliest part
to be translated or that this translation was made for liturgical
purposes. This last point explains the great preponderance of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
MSS. of the version in which the Gospels are arranged in the
form of a lectionary<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Amongst the earliest manuscripts of the Gospels are the
Codex Zographensis, Codex Marianus, and the Codex Assemanicus.
The two first Jagić ascribes to the tenth or eleventh
century. All these are written for the most part in the
Glagolitic character. Besides these, mention must be made of
the Ostromir Codex, written in Cyrillic characters, by Gregory,
a deacon at Novgorod, and dating from the year 1056-7.
In considering the distinctive characteristics of these manuscripts
of the version, the first point to notice is that they
each preserve certain dialectical forms and expressions by
which their place of origin and to some extent their date can be
determined. Thus Miklosich regards the Codex Zographensis
and Codex Assemanicus as preserving Bulgarico-Slovenish forms,
the Ostromir Codex as representative of Russo-Slovenish, and
so on. It is mainly in these particulars that the manuscripts
differ, though there are also other differences by means of which
it has been determined that some Codices, especially those in the
Glagolitic character, preserve the version in a more original form
than others, as for example the Ostromir Codex. These differences
consist<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>, (i) in orthography, (ii) in the fact that the later forms of
the version translate Greek words left untranslated in the older
forms, (iii) in the substitution of later and easier words for
archaisms. It may also be noted that alterations are more
numerous, as might be expected, in copies of the Gospels made
for liturgical purposes than in other copies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same remarks would be true of the second part of the
Bible, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostol</span></span>. This is pointed out by Voskresenski in the
book to which reference has been made, but which is known
to the writer of these lines only from a review. A very careful
examination of the text of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Apostol,”</span> based on the manuscripts
of the Synodal Library, is made by Gorski and
Nevostruiev in the work referred to above, pp. 292 ff.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Oblak has examined the Slavonic version of the Apocalypse,
of which the manuscripts are fewer and later. The earliest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
manuscript is ascribed to the thirteenth century, but the textual
corruption which it exhibits in comparison with other manuscripts
requires that the version which it embodies should be referred
at least to the twelfth century. We do indeed find a quotation
of the Apocalypse (ix. 14) as early as the Isbornik of Sviatoslav
of the year 1073, but in a form so different from the MSS. of the
version now extant, that we must regard it as a quotation from
memory. The MSS. have many small variations, sometimes
merely dialectical, sometimes based on a different Greek text.
They also show marks in places of having been corrected with
the help of the Latin. But in spite of all their variations Oblak
believes that all the manuscripts are to be referred to one common
translation made from a Greek text of the Constantinopolitan
type, which has been here and there corrupted by Western
influence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be noted in conclusion that the earliest dated complete
manuscript of the Gospels is dated 1144, the earliest manuscript
of the whole Bible, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1499, and that the earliest printed
edition is the famous Ostrog Bible of 1581.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remains to say something of the Greek text underlying the
Slavonic version, for this is the special point of view from which
the versions are being here considered. The instances will all be
taken from the Gospels, though others might have been added
from those collected by Gorski. In the first place it is necessary
to draw attention to the fact that for critical purposes a modern
edition of the version will be found insufficient. The following are
cases<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> where the edition published by the British and Foreign
Bible Society, probably based on the Textus Receptus, is misleading
as to the real original reading of the version. In St. Matt.
xi. 2 Codd. Assem., Zograph., Ostrom., all imply the reading διά,
the modern edition δύο: in St. John i. 28 the MSS. have Bethany,
the edition Bethabara; in St. John vii. 39 the MSS. insert, the
edition omits, δεδομένον; in St. Matt. xxv. 2 the MSS. put μωραί
before φρόνιμοι, the edition inverts the order. The Ostromir
Codex presents a later form of the version, and so we find
instances where the other two MSS., just referred to, preserve
what is probably a better reading. Thus in St. Luke ii. 3 they
have οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ, the Ostromir Ἰωσὴφ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ; in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
St. John ix. 8 they have προσαίτης, it has τυφλός; in St. John xix.
14 they have τρίτη, it reads ἕκτη; in St. John xxi. 15 they have
ἀρνία, it has πρόβατα. Again there are cases where one MS. of the
version stands alone. Thus Codex Zogr. stands alone, as against
Assem. and Ostrom., in omitting St. Luke xiv. 24, and inserting
δευτεροπρώτῳ in St. Luke vi. 1. Again in the choice of Slavonic
words for the same Greek original, Cod. Zogr. will agree with
Codex Assem. against Codex Ostrom., though where the Codex
Assemanicus is freer in its rendering, the Ostromir Codex and
Codex Zographensis agree. Sometimes again the Codex Zographensis
is alone in curious readings which seem to be conflations
of the texts found in the other two manuscripts, or based on a
conflate Greek text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This version and the various manuscripts which contain it
have received most attention from Slavonic philologists engaged
in examining the earliest monuments of their language; but
the readings which have been given will be enough to show
that it does not deserve to be dismissed, as summarily as has
been sometimes the case, from the number of those versions
which have a value for purposes of the Textual Criticism of the
New Testament.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Arabic versions (Arab.) are many, though of the slightest
possible critical importance; their literary history, therefore,
need not be traced with much minuteness. A notice is quoted
from Bar-hebraeus (Assemani, Bibl. Or., ii. 335) to the effect that
John, Patriarch of the Monophysites from 631-640, translated
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel”</span> from Syriac into Arabic; and some scholars have
believed in the existence of a pre-Mohammedan version of parts
at least of the New Testament on other grounds; from such
a version (written in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hebrew”</span> character) in the opinion of
Sprenger (Das Leben und die Lehre Muhammads, i. 131) come
the verses of St. John's Gospel (xv. 23-27, xvi. 1), cited by Ibn
Ishaq (ob. 768) in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Life of Mohammed”</span> (ed. Wüstenfeld,
i. 150)<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>. These verses are evidently translated from the (Jerusalem?)
Syriac; but the translation of the Gospel, from the Syriac
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into Arabic, existing in a Leipzig MS. brought by Tischendorf
from the East and described at length by Gildemeister (De
evangeliis in Arabicum e simplici Syriaco translatis, Bonn, 1865)
is shown by internal evidence to be posterior to Islam
(pp. 30 sq.). The Arabic versions of the Gospel existing in
MS. are divided by Guidi (Atti della R. Academia dei Lincei,
classe di scienze morali &amp;c., 1888, 1-30) into five sorts: (1) those
made directly from the Greek; (2) made directly or corrected
from the Peshitto; (3) made directly or corrected from the Coptic;
(4) MSS. of two distinct eclectic recensions made in the Alexandrian
Patriarchate in the thirteenth century; (5) MSS. (chiefly
derived from the Syriac) which are distinguished by their style;
being in rhymed prose or elegant Arabic. MSS. of the first sort
can all, he says, be traced to the convent of St. Saba near
Jerusalem, and are preceded by the lives of its founders,
St. Eutimius and St. Saba; the version they contain is to be
ascribed to the time of the Caliph Mamun (ninth century). Of
the MSS. of class 4, one set represents a recension made by Ibn
El-Assāl, circ. 1250; while another represents a less elaborate
recension made shortly afterwards, in which the passages omitted
in the other were restored, while marginal notes recorded their
omission in other versions. Versions of the fifth class were
made in the tenth, fourteenth, and seventeenth centuries. A list
of MSS. containing the different recensions of all these classes is
given by Guidi, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>, pp. 30-33.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The printed texts all represent varieties of the second eclectic
recension of class 4, of which five editions are enumerated by
Gildemeister(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>, pp. 42, 3, and iv). 1. Roman edition of the Gospels
from the Medicean Press, 1591 (ar.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">r</span></span>), edited by J. Baptista
Raymundi, some copies having a Latin translation by Antonius
Sionita. The MS. on which this edition was based is unknown.
2. Edition of Thomas Erpenius (1584-1624), Leyden, 1616, containing
the whole New Testament (ar.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">e</span></span>). This edition was
based on the Leyden MS., Scaliger 217, written in Egypt in the
year of the Martyrs 1059 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1342-3); two other manuscripts
also employed by Erpenius for the Gospels are now in the
Cambridge University Library (G. 5. 33, and G. 5. 27, written
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1285). A third MS. employed for this edition was in the
Carshunic character. The Acts and Pauline Epistles, the Epistles
of St. James, St. Peter 1 and St. John 1 in this edition are translated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the Peshitto; the remaining Catholic Epistles and the
Apocalypse are from some other source; the latter shows some
remarkable agreement with the Memphitic (Hug, Einleitung in
das N. T., pp. 433-5). 3. Edition of the whole N. T. in the
Paris Polyglott (ar.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">p</span></span>), 1645, reprinted with little alteration in
the London Polyglott (1657). Gildemeister, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>, proves against
Lagarde (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>, xi) that this recension in the Gospels is not an
interpolated reprint of the Roman edition, but is based on a MS.
similar to Paris Anc. f. 27 (of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1619) and Coisl. 239 (new
Suppl. Ar. 27) described by Scholz, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bibl. Krit. Reise,”</span> pp. 56, 58.
The Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse follow the Greek, but are
by another translator. 4. Edition of the whole N. T. in the
Carshunic character (Rome, 1703), edited by Faustus Naironus,
for the use of the Maronites, from a MS. brought from Cyprus,
reprinted Paris, 1827; the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse represent
the same version as that of Erpenius, but in a different
recension. 5. Edition of the four Gospels from a Vienna MS.
(previously described by S. C. Storr, Dissertatio inauguralis
critica de evangeliis Arabicis, Tübingen, 1875, p. 17 sq.), by
P. de Lagarde (Die vier Evangelien Arabisch, Leipzig, 1864). The
MS. contains various readings from the Coptic, Syriac, and Latin
(according to Lagarde, Gildemeister more naturally renders rūmī
by Greek). The editor has prefixed a table of variants between
his text and that of Erpenius, but regards the relation of the
former to the original as involving questions too complicated for
immediate discussion (p. xxxi).

Extracts from MSS. of Arabic versions in French and Italian

There is but one known version of the four Gospels (the only
portion of the N. T. that was translated into A.-S.); this version
was made, probably in the South-West of England at or near
Bath, in the last quarter of the tenth century. It is preserved in
four MSS.: (Corp.) Corpus Christi Coll. Camb. MS. 140; (B)
Bodleian Lib. MS. 441; (C) Cotton MS. Otho C. I (seriously
injured by fire), and (A) Camb. Univ. Lib. MS. Ii. 2. 11. Of
these the first three may be dated, in round number, about the
year 1000; the fourth (A) belongs to the following half-century.
The Bodl. Lib. has also recently acquired a fragment of four
leaves of St. John's Gospel, which agrees closely with A.

It may also be mentioned that there are in the Brit. Mus.
two additional copies of this version (Bibl. Reg. MS. I. A. xiv,

second is copied from the first.

Next in importance to this version are the two following Latin
MSS. of the four Gospels, with an interlinear Anglo-Saxon gloss.
(1) MS. Nero D. 4 (the Lindisfarne MS., also known as the Durham
Book). The Latin was written by Eadfrith, bishop of Lindisfarne
698-721; the interlinear gloss being about two and a half
centuries later, made near Durham about the year 950. (2) The
Rushworth MS. (Bodl. Lib. Auct. D. ii. 19). The Latin was
written by the scribe Macregol, probably in the eighth century.
The gloss, by the scribes Farman and Owun, is referred to the
latter half of the tenth century. These two Latin texts differ
but slightly; they are also of the Vulgate types.

by Samuel Clarke (which C. A. Bode thought it worth his

Peshitto. (2) The second, though apparently modern [xiv?]
was made from the Greek (pers.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">w</span></span>). Its publication was commenced
in 1652 by Abraham Wheelocke, Professor of Arabic
and Anglo-Saxon and University Librarian at Cambridge, at the
expense of Sir Th. Adams, the generous and loyal alderman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of London. The basis (as appears from the volume itself) was
an Oxford codex (probably Laud. A. 96 of the old notation),
which Wheelocke, in his elaborate notes at the end of each
chapter, compared with Pocock's and with a third manuscript at
Cambridge (Gg. v. 26), dated 1014 of the Hegira (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1607).
On Wheelocke's death in 1653 only 108 pages (to Matt, xviii. 6)
were printed, but his whole text and Latin version being found
ready for the press, the book was published with a second
title-page, dated London, 1657, and a short Preface by an
anonymous editor (said to be one Pierson), who in lieu of
Wheelocke's notes, which break off after Matt. xvii., appended
a simple collation of the Pocock manuscript from that place.
The Persians have older versions, parts of both Testaments,
still unpublished. There is another copy of the Persian
Gospels at Cambridge, which once belonged to Archbishop
Bancroft, and was brought from Lambeth in 1646, but was not
restored in 1662 with the other books belonging to the Lambeth
Library.

1. We might at first sight be inclined to suppose that the
numerous quotations from the New Testament contained
in the remains of the Fathers of the Church and other Christian
writers from the first century of our era downwards, would be
more useful even than the early versions, for enabling us to
determine the character of the text of Scripture current in those
primitive times, from which no manuscripts of the original have

volume entitled the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision Revised<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>,”</span> has shown scholars
how vast a body of valuable illustrations has received inadequate
attention. But not to insist on the fact that many important
passages of the New Testament have not been cited at all in any
very ancient work now extant, this species of evidence labours
under difficulties peculiarly its own. Not only is this kind of
testimony fragmentary and not (like that of versions) continuous,
so that it often fails us where we should most wish for information:
but the Fathers were better theologians than critics; they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sometimes quoted loosely, or from memory, often no more of
a passage than their immediate purpose required; and what they
actually wrote has been found liable to change on the part of
copyists and unskilful editors. But when all is considered, the
Fathers must be at least held under due limitations to be witnesses
to the readings found in the codices which they used. If
theirs is secondary evidence, it is nevertheless in many cases
virtually older than any that can be had from MSS. of the entire
text. The fewness of early MSS. adds importance to other early
testimony. And the strength of this kind of evidence is found
at the highest, when the issue is of a somewhat broader character
than usual, and when a large number of quotations are found to
corroborate testimony from MSS. and the testimony of Versions.
In fact the strength of their evidence is to be seen especially in
three aspects: First, they supply us with numerous codices, though
at second hand, at a very early date; secondly, there is no doubt
whatever that the date of the codices used by them is not later
than when they wrote, and their own date is usually a matter of
no question; and thirdly, they help us to assign the locality to
remarkable readings<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a>. In other words, the unknown MS.
derives life and character from the Father who uses it<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a>. On
the other hand, the same author perpetually cites the selfsame
text under two or more various forms; in the Gospels it is
often impossible to determine to which of the three earlier
ones reference is made; and, on the whole, where Scriptural
quotations from ecclesiastical writers are single and unsupported,
they may safely be disregarded altogether. An <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">express</span></em> citation,
however, by a really careful Father of the first four or five
centuries (as Origen, for example), if supported by manuscript
authority, and countenanced by the best versions, claims our
respectful attention, and powerfully vindicates the reading
which it favours<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>. In fact, like Versions, Patristic citations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cannot be taken primarily to establish any reading. But they
are often invaluable in supplying support to manuscriptal
authority, whether by proving a primitive antiquity, or in
demonstrating by an overwhelming body of testimony that the
passage or reading was accepted in all ages and in many
provinces of the earlier church. Frequently also, they are of
unquestionable use, when they bear witness in a less striking
manner, or in smaller number.

2. The practice of illustrating the various readings of Scripture
from the reliques of Christian antiquity is so obvious and reasonable,
that all who have written critical annotations on the sacred
text have resorted to it, from Erasmus downwards: the Greek or
Latin commentators are appealed to in four out of the five
marginal notes found in the Complutensian N. T. When
Bishop Fell, however, came to prepare the first edition of the
Greek Testament attended with any considerable apparatus for
improving the text, he expressly rejected <span class="tei tei-q">“S. Textus loca ab
antiquis Patribus aliter quam pro recepto more laudata,”</span> from
which the toil of such a task did not so much deter him, <span class="tei tei-q">“quam
cogitatio quod minus utile esset futurum iisdem insistere.”</span>
(N. T. 1675, Praef.). <span class="tei tei-q">“Venerandi enim illi scriptores,”</span> he adds,
<span class="tei tei-q">“de verborum apicibus non multum soliciti, ex memoriâ quae ad
institutum suum factura videbantur passim allegabant; unde
factum ut de priscâ lectione ex illorum scriptis nil ferè certi
potuerit hauriri.”</span> It is certainly to the credit of Mill's sagacity
that he did not follow his patron's example by setting aside
Patristic testimony in so curt and compendious a manner<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>.
Nevertheless, no one can study Mill's <span class="tei tei-q">“Prolegomena”</span> without
being conscious of the fact, that the portion of them relating to the
history of the text, as gathered from ecclesiastical writers, and the
accumulation of that mass of quotations from the Fathers which
stands below his Scripture text, must have been, what he asserts,
the result of some years' labour (N. T. Proleg. § 1513): yet these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are just the parts of his celebrated work that have given the least
satisfaction. The field indeed is too vast to be occupied by one
man. A whole library of authors has to be thoroughly searched;
each cited passage must be patiently examined; the help of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indices</span></em>
should be employed critically and warily; the best editions must
be used, and even then the text of the very writers is to be
corrected, so far as may be, by the collation of other manuscripts<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>.

3. To Griesbach must be assigned the merit of being the
earliest editor of the Greek Testament who saw, or at least who
acted upon the principle, that it is far more profitable as well
as more scholarlike to do one thing well, than to attempt more
than can be performed completely and with accuracy. He was
led by certain textual theories he had adopted, and which we
shall best describe hereafter, to a close examination of the works
of Origen, the most celebrated Biblical critic of antiquity. The
result, published in the second volume of his Symbolae Criticae,
is a lasting monument both of his industry and acuteness; and,
if not quite faultless in point of correctness, deserves to be taken
as a model by his successors. Tregelles, of whose Greek Testament
we shall presently speak, has evidently bestowed much
pains on his Patristic citations; to Eusebius of Caesarea,
especially to those portions of his works which have been
recently edited or brought to light, he has paid great attention:
but besides many others, Chrysostom has been grievously
neglected, although the subjects of a large portion of his
writings, the early date of some of his codices<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>, the extensive
collations of Matthaei, and the excellent modern editions of most
of his Homilies, might have sufficed to commend him to our
particular regard. The custom, commenced by Lachmann, and
adopted by Tregelles (though not uniformly by Tischendorf),
of recording the exact edition, volume, and page of the writer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quoted, and in important cases of copying his very words, cannot
be too much praised: we would suggest, however, the expediency
of further indicating, by an asterisk or some such mark, those
passages about which there can be no ambiguity as to the reading
adopted by the author, in order to distinguish them from
others which are of infinitely less weight and importance.

4. But the greatest step of all towards an extended use of
Patristic testimony has been taken by Dean Burgon, and since
his much lamented death the results of his labours have been
made public. In the early stages of his studies in Sacred Textual
Criticism, Burgon saw the extreme value—afterwards recognized
by Dr. Scrivener—of an exhaustive use of citations from the
Fathers and other ecclesiastical authors; and after a conversation
with the Earl of Cranbrook, then Mr. Gathorne Hardy, he set
himself upon the vast task of collecting indices of New Testament
quotations occurring in the books of those writers. <span class="tei tei-q">“This
involved his looking through all the Greek and Latin folios of
the Fathers, and marking the texts in the margin. Then the
folios passed into the hands of his assistants, who arranged the
references in the order of the Books of the New Testament, and
copied them out; so that it might be only the work of a minute
to ascertain how Cyril, or Eusebius, or Gregory of Nyssa quoted
such a text<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a>,”</span> and how many times it was quoted by the Father
in question. They were revised and enlarged some years after
their first collection. The striking use to which Burgon put
his own indices has been already noticed. After his death the
sixteen stout volumes containing them were acquired by the
authorities of the British Museum, where they have been found
to be of much use in cataloguing. Steps have been already
taken for the publication of the part relating to the Gospels with
Dean Burgon's other works on this great subject.

5. It may be convenient to subjoin an alphabetical list of the
ecclesiastical writers, both in Greek and Latin and in other
languages (with the usual abridgements for their names), which
are the most often cited in critical editions of the New Testament.
The Latin authors are printed in italics, and unless they
happen to appeal unequivocally to the evidence of Greek codices,
are available only for the correction of their vernacular translation.

It would be quite foreign to our present design, to attempt
to notice all the editions of the New Testament in Greek
which have appeared in the course of the last three centuries and
a half, nor would a large volume suffice for such a labour. We
will limit our attention, therefore, to those early editions which
have contributed to form our commonly received text, and to
such others of more recent date as not only exhibit a revised
text, but contain an accession of fresh critical materials for its
more complete emendation<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the Latin or <span class="tei tei-q">“Mazarin”</span> Bible, printed between 1452 and
1456, was the first production of the new-born printing-press
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> above, p. <a href="#Pg061" class="tei tei-ref">61</a>), and the Jews had published the Hebrew Bible
in 1488, we must impute it to the general ignorance of Greek
among divines in Western Europe, that although the two songs,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magnificat</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Benedictus</span></span> (Luke i), were annexed to a Greek

name; next at Venice in 1486, being edited by a Greek; again
at Venice from the press of Aldus in 1496 or 1497: and although
the first six chapters of St. John's Gospel were published at
Venice by Aldus Manutius in 1504, and John vi. 1-14 at
Tübingen in 1514, yet the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">printed</span></em> edition of the whole
in N. T. the original is that contained in—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Complutensian Polyglott</span></span><a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> (6 vols., folio), the
munificent design of Francis Ximenes de Cisneros [1437-1517],
Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, and Regent of Castile
(1506-1517). This truly eminent person, six years of whose
humble youth were spent in a dungeon through the caprice of
one of his predecessors in the Primacy of Spain, experienced
what we have seen so conspicuously illustrated in other instances,
that long imprisonment ripens the intellect which it fails to
extinguish. Entering the Franciscan order in 1482, he carried
the ascetic habit of his profession to the throne of Toledo and
the palace of his sovereign. Becoming in 1492 Confessor to
Queen Isabella the Catholic, and Primate three years later, he
devoted to pure charity or to public purposes the enormous
revenues of his see; founding the University at Alcalá de
Henares in New Castile, where he had gone to school, and
defraying the cost of an expedition which as Regent he led to
Oran against the Moors. In 1502 he conceived the plan of the
first Polyglott Bible, to celebrate the birth of him who afterwards
became the Emperor Charles V, and gathered in his University
of Alcalá (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Complutum</span></span>) as many manuscripts as he could procure,
with men he deemed equal to the task, of whom James Lopez de
Stunica (subsequently known for his controversy with Erasmus)
was the principal: others being Æ. Antonio of Lebrixa, Demetrius
Ducas of Crete, and Ferdinand of Valladolid (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pintianus</span></span>).
The whole outlay of Cardinal Ximenes on the Polyglott is
stated to have exceeded 50,000 ducats or about £23,000, a vast
sum in those days:—but his yearly income as Primate was
four times as great. The first volume printed, Tom. v, contains
the New Testament in two parallel columns, Greek and
Latin, the latter being that modification of the Vulgate then
current: the colophon on the last page of the Apocalypse states
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that it was completed January 10, 1514, the printer being
Arnald William de Brocario. Tom. vi, comprising a Lexicon,
indices, &amp;c., bears date March 17, 1515; Tom. i-iv of the Old
Testament and Apocrypha, 1517 (Tom. iv dated July 10), on
November 8 of which year the Cardinal died, full of honours and
good deeds. This event must have retarded the publication of
the whole, since Pope Leo's licence was not granted until March
22, 1520, and Erasmus did not see the book before 1522. As
not more than six hundred copies were printed, this Polyglott
must from the first have been scarce and dear, and is not always
met with in Public Libraries.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Apocryphal books, like the N. T., are of course given
only in two languages; in the Old Testament the Latin Vulgate
holds the chief place in the middle, between the Hebrew
and the Septuagint Greek<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a>. The Greek type in the other
volumes is of the common character, with the usual breathings
and accents; in the fifth, or New Testament volume, it is
quite different, being modelled after the fashion of manuscripts
of about the thirteenth century, very bold and elegant (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
Plate x, No. 26), without breathings, and accentuated according
to a system defended and explained in a bilingual preface

monosyllables have no accent, while in other words the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tone</span></em> syllable
receives the acute, the grave and circumflex being discarded.
The Latin is in a noble church-character, references are made
from the one text to the other by means of small letters, and
where in either column there is a void space, in consequence of
words omitted or otherwise, it is filled up by such curves as
are seen in the bottom line of our specimen. The foreign
matter in this volume consists of the short Preface in Latin
and Greek, Eusebius Carpiano (but without the canons),
Jerome's letter to Damasus, with the ordinary Latin Prologues
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Arguments before each book. St. Paul's Epistles precede
the Acts, as in Codd. א, 61, 69, 90, &amp;c. and before them stand
the ἀποδημία παύλου, Euthalii περὶ χρόνων, the ordinary ὑποθέσεις
to all the twenty-one Epistles (grouped together), with
Theodoret's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prologues</span></span> subjoined to thirteen of the ὑποθέσεις.
By the side of the Latin text are numerous parallel passages,
and there are also five marginal notes (on Matt. vi. 13;
1 Cor. xiii. 3; xv. 31; 51; 1 John v. 7, 8). The only divisions
are the common Latin chapters, subdivided by the letters
A, B, C, D, &amp;c. Copies of laudatory verses<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>, an interpretation
of Proper Names, and a Greek Lexicon of the N. T., close the
volume.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has long been debated among critics, what manuscripts
were used by the Complutensian editors, especially in the N. T.
Ximenes is reported to have spent 4,000 ducats in the purchase
of such manuscripts; in the Preface to the N. T. we are assured
that <span class="tei tei-q">“non quevis exemplaria impressioni huic archetypa fuisse:
sed antiquissima emendatissimaque: ac tante preterea vetustatis,
ut fidem eis abrogare nefas videatur: Que sanctissimus in
Christo pater et dominus noster Leo decimus pontifex maximus,
huic instituto favere cupiens ex apostolica bibliotheca educta
misit....”</span> Yet these last expressions can hardly refer to the
N. T., inasmuch as Leo X was not elected Pope till March 11,
1513, and the N. T. was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">completed</span></em> Jan. 10 of the very next
year<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>. Add to this that Vercellone, whose services to sacred
literature have been spoken of above, brought to light the
fact that only two manuscripts are recorded as having been
sent to the Cardinal from the Vatican in the first year of Leo,
and neither of them (Vat. 330, 346) contained any part of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the N. T.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> The only one of the Complutensian codices specified
by Stunica, the Cod. Rhodiensis (Act. 52), has entirely disappeared,
and from a Catalogue of the thirty volumes of Biblical
manuscripts once in the library at Alcalà, but now at Madrid,
communicated in 1846 by Don José Gutierrez, the Librarian,
we find that they consist exclusively of Latin and Hebrew
books, with the exception of two which contain portions of the
Septuagint in Greek<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>. Thus we seem cut off from all hope
of obtaining direct information as to the age, character, and
present locality of the materials employed for the Greek text of
this edition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is obvious, however, that in the course of twelve years
(1502-14), Ximenes may have obtained <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcripts</span></em> of codices
he did not himself possess, and since some of the more remarkable
readings of the Complutensian are found in but one or
two manuscripts (e.g. Luke i. 64 in Codd. 140, 251; ii. 22 in
Cod. 76), such copies should of course be narrowly watched.
We have pointed out above the resemblance that Siedel's
codex (Act. 42, Paul. 48, Apoc. 13) bears to this edition: so
too Cod. 4 of the Gospels. Mill first noticed its affinity to
Laud. 2 or Evan. 51, Act. 32, Paul. 38 (Evan. 51), and though
this is somewhat remote in the Gospels, throughout the Acts
and Epistles it is close and indubitable<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>. We see, therefore,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no cause for believing that either Cod. B, or any manuscript
much resembling it in character, or any other document of high
antiquity or first-rate importance, was employed by the editors
of this Polyglott. The text it exhibits does not widely differ
from that of most codices written from the tenth century downwards.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That it was corrupted from the parallel Latin version was
contended by Wetstein and others on very insufficient grounds.
Even the Latinism βεελζεβούβ Matt. x. 25, seems a mere inadvertence,
and is corrected immediately afterwards (xii. 24, 27),
as well as in the four other places wherein the word is used. We
need not deny that 1 John v. 7, 8 was interpolated, and probably
translated from the Vulgate; and a few other cases have a suspicious
look (Rom. xvi. 5; 2 Cor. v. 10; vi. 15; and especially
Gal. iii. 19); the articles too are employed as if they were
unfamiliar to the editor (e.g. Acts xxi. 4; 8): yet we must
emphatically deny that on the whole the Latin Vulgate had an
appreciable effect upon the Greek. This last point had been
demonstrated to the satisfaction of Michaelis and of Marsh by
Goeze<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>, in whose short tract many readings of Cod. Laud. 2 are
also examined. In the more exact collation of the N. T., which
we have made with the common text (Elzevir 1624), and which
appeared in the first edition of the present work, out of 2,780
places in all, wherein the Complutensian edition differs from that
of Elzevir (viz. 1,046 in the Gospels, 578 in the Pauline Epistles,
542 in the Acts and Catholic Epistles, 614 in the Apocalypse), in
no less than 849 the Latin is at variance with the Greek; in the
majority of the rest the difference cannot be expressed in another
language. Since the Complutensian N. T. could only have been
published from manuscripts, it deserves more minute examination
than it has received from Mill or Wetstein; and it were much to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be desired that minute collations could be made of several other
early editions, especially the whole five of Erasmus.

Since this Polyglott has been said to be very inaccurately printed, it
is necessary to state that we have noted just fifty pure errors of the
press; in one place, moreover (Heb. vii. 3), part of the ninth Euthalian
κεφάλαιον (εν ω ότι και του αβραάμ προετιμήθη) has crept into the text.
All the usual peculiarities observable in later manuscripts are here,
e.g. 224 itacisms (chiefly ω for ο, η for ει, ει for ι, υ for η, οι for ει, and
vice versâ); thirty-two instances of ν ἐφελκυστικόν, or the superabundant
ν, before a consonant; fifteen cases of the hiatus for the lack of ν before
a vowel; ουτως is sometimes found before a consonant, but ουτω sixty-eight
times; ουκ and ουχ are interchanged twelve times. The following
peculiarities, found in many manuscripts, and here retained, may show
that the grammatical forms of the Greek were not yet settled among
scholars; παρήνγελεν Mark vi. 8; διάγγελε Luke ix. 60; καταγγέλειν
Acts iv. 2; διαγγέλων Acts xxi. 26; καταγγέλων 1 Cor. ii. 1; παραγγέλω
1 Cor. vii. 10; αναγγέλλων 2 Cor. vii. 7; παραγγέλομεν 2 Thess. iii. 4;
παράγγελε 1 Tim. iv. 11; v. 7; vi. 17. The augment is omitted nine
times (Matt. xi. 17; Acts vii. 42; xxvi. 32; Rom. i. 2; Gal. ii. 13;
1 Tim. vi. 10; 2 Tim. i. 16; Apoc. iv. 8; xii. 17); the reduplication
twice (John xi. 52; 1 Cor. xi. 5); μέλλω and μέλει are confounded,
Mark iv. 38; Acts xviii. 17; Apoc. iii. 2; xii. 4. Other anomalous
forms (some of them would be called Alexandrian) are παμπόλου Mark

in the Greek, being (.), (,), rarely (·), never (;). In the Latin the
stops are pretty regular, but the abbreviations very numerous, even such
purely arbitrary forms as </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; text-decoration: underline">xps</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> for </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Christus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. In the Greek σ often stands at
the end of a word for ς, ï and often ü or </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">υ</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> are set at the beginning of
syllables: there are no instances of ι </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ascript</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">subscript</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, and no capital
letters except at the beginning of a chapter, when they are often flourished.
The following forms are also derived from the general practice of manuscripts,
and occur perpetually: απάρτι, απάρχης, δαν (for δ᾽ ἂν), ειμή, εξαυτής,
επιτοαυτό, εφόσον, εωσότου, καίτοιγε, καθημέραν, κατιδίαν, κατόναρ, μεθήμων,
μέντοι, ουμή, τουτέστι; and for the most part διαπαντός, διατί, διατούτο, είτις,
ουκέτι. Sometimes the preposition and its case make but a single word,

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Erasmus' New Testament</span></span> was by six years the earlier
published, though it was printed two years later than the
Complutensian. Its editor, both in character and fortunes,
presents a striking contrast with Ximenes; yet what he lacked
of the Castilian's firmness he more than atoned for by his true
love of learning, and the cheerfulness of spirit that struggled
patiently, if not boldly, with adversity. Desiderius Erasmus
(ἐράσμιος, i.e. Gerald) was born at Rotterdam in 1465, or, perhaps,
a year or two later, the illegitimate son of reputable and (but for
that sin) of virtuous parents. Soon left an orphan, he was forced
to take reluctantly the minor orders, and entered the priesthood
in 1492. Thenceforward his was the hard life of a solitary and
wandering man of letters, earning a precarious subsistence from
booksellers or pupils<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>, now learning Greek at Oxford (but
αὐτοδίδακτος)<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>, now teaching it at Cambridge (1510); losing by
his reckless wit the friends his vast erudition had won; restless
and unfrugal, perhaps, yet always labouring faithfully and with
diligence. He was in England when John Froben, a celebrated
publisher at Basle, moved by the report of the forthcoming
Spanish Bible and eager to forestall it, made application to
Erasmus, through a common friend, to undertake immediately
an edition of the N. T.: <span class="tei tei-q">“se daturum pollicetur, quantum alius
quisquam,”</span> is the argument employed. This proposal was sent
on April 17, 1515, years before which time Erasmus had prepared
numerous annotations to illustrate a revised Latin version he had
long projected. On September 11 it was yet unsettled whether
this, improved version should stand by the Greek in a parallel
column (the plan actually adopted), or be printed separately:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet the colophon at the end of Erasmus' first edition, a large
folio of 1,027 pages in all, is dated February, 1516; the end of
the Annotations, March 1, 1516; Erasmus' dedication to Leo X,
Feb. 1, 1516; and Froben's Preface, full of joyful hope and honest
pride in the friendship of the first of living authors, Feb. 24, 1516.
Well might Erasmus, who had besides other literary engagements
to occupy his time, declare subsequently that the volume <span class="tei tei-q">“praecipitatum
fuit verius quam editum;”</span> yet both on the title-page,
and in his dedication to the Pope, he allows himself to employ
widely different language<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a>. When we read the assurance he
addressed to Leo, <span class="tei tei-q">“Novum ut vocant testamentum universum ad
Graecae originis fidem recognovimus, idque non temere neque
levi opera, sed adhibitis in consilium compluribus utriusque
linguae codicibus, nec iis sane quibuslibet, sed vetustissimis
simul et emendatissimis,”</span> it is almost painful to be obliged to
remember that a portion of ten months at the utmost could have
been devoted to his task by Erasmus; while the only manuscripts
he can be imagined to have constantly used are Codd.
Evan. 2, Act. Paul. 2 and Paul. 7, with occasional reference to
Evan. Act. Paul. 1 and Act. Paul. 4 (all still at Basle) for the
remainder of the New Testament, to which add Apoc. 1,
now happily recovered, alone for the Apocalypse. All these,
excepting Evan. Act. Paul. 1, were neither ancient nor
particularly valuable, and of Cod. 1 he professed to make but
small account<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>. As Apoc. 1 was mutilated in the last six
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verses, Erasmus turned these into Greek from the Latin;
and some portions of his self-made version, which are found
(however some editors may speak vaguely) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in no one known
Greek manuscript whatever</span></em>, still cleave to our received text<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>.
Besides this scanty roll, however, he not rarely refers in
his Annotations to other manuscripts he had seen in the course
of his travels (e.g. on Heb. i. 3; Apoc. i. 4; viii. 13), yet too
indistinctly for his allusions to be of much use to critics. Some
such readings, as alleged by him, have not been found elsewhere
(e.g. Acts xxiv. 23; Rom. xii. 20), and may have been cited
loosely from distant recollection (comp. Col. iii. 3; Heb. iv. 12;
2 Pet. iii. 1; Apoc. ii. 18).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Ximenes, in the last year of his life, was shown Erasmus'
edition which had thus got the start of his own, and his editor,
Stunica, sought to depreciate it, the noble old man replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“would God that all the Lord's people were prophets! produce
better, if thou canst; condemn not the industry of another<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>.”</span>
His generous confidence in his own work was not misplaced. He
had many advantages over the poor scholar and the enterprising
printer of Basle, and had not let them pass unimproved. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
typographical errors of the Complutensian Greek have been
stated; Erasmus' first edition is in that respect the most faulty
book I know. Oecolampadius, or John Hausschein of Basle
[1482-1531], afterwards of some note as a disputer with Luther
on the Sacramentarian controversy, had undertaken this
department for him; and was glad enough to serve under such
a chief; but Froben's hot haste gave him little leisure to do
his part. No less than 501 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">itacisms</span></span> are imported from the
manuscripts into his printed text, and the ν ἐφελκυστικόν is perpetually
used with verbs, before a consonant beginning the next
word. We must, however, impute it to design that ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span>,
which is elsewhere placed pretty correctly, is here set under
η in the plural of the subjunctive mood active, but not in the
singular (e.g. James ii. ἐπιβλέψῃτε, εἴπῃτε <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></span>, but ver. 2 εἰσέλθη
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></span>). With regard to the text, the difference between the two
editions is very wide in the Apocalypse, the text of the Complutensian
being decidedly preferable; elsewhere they resemble each
other more closely, and while we fully admit the error of Stunica
and his colleagues in translating from the Latin version into
Greek, 1 John v. 7, 8, it would appear that Erasmus has elsewhere
acted in the same manner, not merely in cases which for
the moment admitted no choice, but in places where no such
necessity existed: thus in Acts ix. 5, 6, the words from σκληρόν
to πρὸς αὐτόν are interpolated from the Vulgate, partly by the
help of Acts xxvi<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>.

Erasmus died at Basle in 1536, having lived to publish four
editions besides that of 1516. The second has enlarged annotations,
and very truly bears on its title the statement <span class="tei tei-q">“multo
quam antehac diligentius ab Er. Rot. recognitum;”</span> for a large
portion of the misprints, and not a few readings of the first
edition, are herein corrected, the latter chiefly on the authority
of a fresh codex, Evan. Act. Paul. 3; The colophon to the
Apocalypse is dated 1518, Froben's Epistle to the reader, Feb.
5, 1519. In this edition ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span> is for the most part set

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Gospels; Dorotheus' <span class="tei tei-q">“Lives of the Four Evangelists”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Act. 89) stood before St. Matthew in 1516; but now the
longer <span class="tei tei-q">“Lives”</span> by Sophronius, with Theophylact's <span class="tei tei-q">“Prologues,”</span>
are set before each Gospel. Κεφάλαια (not the Euthalian)
are given in both editions in Rom. 1, 2 Corinth. only, but the
Latin chapters are represented in the margin throughout, with
the subdivisions A, B, C, D. Of these two editions put together
3,300 copies were printed. The third edition (1522) is
chiefly remarkable for its insertion of 1 John v. 7, 8 in the
Greek text<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a>, under the circumstances described above, Vol. I.
p. 200, in consequence of Erasmus' controversy with Stunica and
H. Standish, Bp. of St. Asaph (d. 1534), and with a much weaker
antagonist, Edward Lee, afterwards Archbishop of York, who
objected to his omission of a passage which no Greek codex was
then known to contain. This edition again was said to be
<span class="tei tei-q">“tertio jam ac diligentius ... recognitum,”</span> and contains also
<span class="tei tei-q">“Capita argumentorum contra morosos quosdam ac indoctos,”</span>
which he subsequently found reason to enlarge. The fourth
edition (dated March, 1527) contains the text in three parallel
columns, the Greek, the Latin Vulgate, and Erasmus' recension of
it. He had seen the Complutensian Polyglott in 1522, shortly
after the publication of his third edition, and had now the good
sense to avail himself of its aid in the improvement of the text,
especially in the Apocalypse, wherein he amended from it at
least ninety readings. His last edition of 1535 once more discarded
the Latin Vulgate, and differs very little from the fourth
as regards the text<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A minute collation of all Erasmus' editions is a desideratum
we may one day come to see supplied. The present writer hopes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
soon to publish a full comparison of his first and second editions

of Beza 1565, and of Elzevir 1624. All who have followed Mill
over any portion of the vast field he endeavoured to occupy, will
feel certain that his statements respecting their divergences are
much below the truth: such as they are, we repeat them for
want of more accurate information. He estimates that Erasmus'

3. In 1518 appeared the Graeca Biblia at Venice, from the
celebrated press of Aldus: the work professes to be grounded on
a collation of many most ancient copies<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>. However true this
must be with regard to the Old Testament, which was now published
in Greek for the first time, Aldus follows the first edition
of Erasmus so closely in the New as to reproduce his very
errors of the press (Mill, N. T., Proleg. § 1122), even those
which Oecolampadius had corrected in the list of errata;
though Aldus is stated to differ from Erasmus in about 200
places, for the better or worse<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>. If this edition was really
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
revised by means of manuscripts (Cod. 131) rather than by
mere conjecture, we know not what they were, or how far
intelligently employed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another edition out of the many which now began to swarm,
wherein the testimony of manuscripts is believed to have been
followed, is that of Simon Colinaeus, Paris, 1534, in which the
text is an eclectic mixture of the Complutensian and Erasmian<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>.
Mill states (Proleg. § 1144) that in about 150 places Colinaeus
deserts them both, and that his variations are usually supported
by the evidence of known codices (Evan. 119, 120 at Paris, and
Steph. ια᾽, i.e. Act. 8, Paul. 10, have been suggested), though
a few still remain which may perhaps be deemed conjectural.
Wetstein (N. T., Proleg. vol. i. p. 142) thinks that for Bogard's
Paris edition of 1543 with various readings Evan. 120 or Steph.
ιδ᾽ might have been used, but his own references hardly favour
that notion.

4. The editions of Robert Stephen (Estienne), mainly by
reason of their exquisite beauty, have exercised a far wider
influence than these, and Stephen's third or folio edition of 1550
is by many regarded as the received or standard text. This
eminent and resolute man [1503-59], <span class="tei tei-q">“whose Biblical work taken
altogether had perhaps more influence than that of any other
single man in the sixteenth century<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>,”</span> early commenced his useful
career as a printer at Paris, and, having incurred the enmity
of the Doctors of the Sorbonne for his editions of the Latin
Vulgate, was yet protected and patronised by Francis I [d. 1547]
and his son Henry II. It was from the Royal Press that
his three principal editions of the Greek N. T. were issued, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fourth and last being published in 1551 at Geneva, to which
town he finally withdrew the next year, and made public
profession of the Protestant opinions which had long been
gathering strength in his mind. The editions of 1546, 1549 are
small 12mo in size, most elegantly printed with type cast at the
expense of Francis: the opening words of the Preface common to
both, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">O mirificam</span></span> Regis nostri optimi et praestantissimi
principis liberalitatem...”</span> have given them the name by which
they are known among connoisseurs. Erasmus and his services
to sacred learning Stephen does not so much as name, nor indeed
did he as yet adopt him for a model: he speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“codices ipsa
vetustatis specie pene adorandos”</span> which he had met with in the
King's Library, by which, he boldly adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“ita hunc nostrum
recensuimus, ut nullam omnino literam secus esse pateremur
quam plures, iique meliores libri, tanquam testes, comprobarent.”</span>
The Complutensian, as he admits, assisted him greatly, and he
notes its close connexion with the readings of his manuscripts<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>.
Mill assures us (Proleg. § 1220) that Stephen's first and second
editions differ but in sixty-seven places. My own collation of
the two books gives 139 cases of divergence in the text, twenty-eight
in punctuation. They differ jointly from the third edition
334 times in the text, twenty-seven in punctuation. In the
Apocalypse the first and second editions are close to the text of
Erasmus, differing from each other but in eleven places, while
the third edition follows the Complutensian or other authorities
against the first in sixty-one places. In the folio or third edition
of 1550 the various readings of the codices, obscurely referred to
in the Preface to that of 1546, are entered in the margin. This
fine volume (bearing on its title-page, in honour of Henry II, the
inscription Βασιλεῖ τ᾽ ἀγαθῷ, κρατερῷ τ᾽ αἰχμητῇ) derives much
importance from its being the earliest ever published with critical
apparatus. In the Preface or Epistle to the Reader, written after
the example of the Complutensian editors both in Greek and
Latin, his authorities are declared to be sixteen; viz. α', the
Spanish Polyglott; β', which we have already discussed (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
p. <a href="#Pg124" class="tei tei-ref">124</a>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">note</span></span> 3), γ᾽, δ᾽, ε᾽ ϛ᾽, ζ᾽, η᾽, ι᾽, ιε᾽ taken from King Henry II's
Library; the rest (i.e. θ᾽, ια᾽, ιβ᾽, ιγ᾽, ιδ᾽, ιϛ᾽) are those ἂ αὐτοὶ
πανταχόθεν συνηθροίσαμεν, or, as the Latin runs, <span class="tei tei-q">“quae undique
corrogare licuit:”</span> these, of course, were not necessarily his
own, one at least (ιγ᾽, Act. 9, Paul. 11) we are sure was not.
Although Robert Stephen professed to have collated the whole
sixteen for his two previous editions, and that too ὡς οἷόν τε
ἦν ἐπιμελέστατα, this part of his work is now known to be due
to his son Henry [1528-98], who in 1546 was only eighteen
years old (Wetstein, N. T., Proleg., vol. i. pp. 143-4). The degree
of accuracy attained in this collation may be estimated from the
single instance of the Complutensian, a book printed in very
clear type, widely circulated, and highly valued by Stephen
himself. Deducting mere <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">errata</span></span>, itacisms, and such like, it differs
from his third edition in more than 2,300 places, of which
(including cases where π. or πάντες stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> his copies) it is
cited correctly 554 times (viz. 164 in the Gospels, ninety-four in
St. Paul, seventy-six in the Acts and Catholic Epistles, 220 in
the Apocalypse), and falsely no less than fifty-six times, again
including errors from a too general use of πάντες<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a>. I would not
say with some that these authorities stand in the margin more
for parade than use, yet the text is perpetually at variance with
the majority of them, and in 119 places with them all<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a>. If we
trust ourselves once more to the guidance of Mill (Proleg. § 1228),
the folio of 1550 departs from its smaller predecessors of 1546,
1549, in 284 readings<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>, chiefly to adopt the text of Erasmus' fifth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
edition, though even now the Complutensian is occasionally
preferred (e.g. εὐλογήσας Matt. xxvi. 26), most often in the
Apocalypse, and that with very good reason. Of his other
fifteen authorities, ια᾽ (= Act. 8) and ιϛ᾽ (= Apoc. 3) have never
been identified, but were among the six in private hands:
β᾽ certainly is Cod. D or Bezae; the learned have tried, and
on the whole successfully, to recognize the remainder, especially
those in the Royal (or Imperial, or National) Library at Paris.
In that great collection Le Long has satisfied us that γ᾽ is
probably Evan. 4; δ᾽ is certainly Evan. 5; ε᾽ Evan. 6; ϛ᾽
Evan. 7; η᾽ Evan. L; ζ᾽ he rightly believed to be Evan. 8
(above, p. <a href="#Pg191" class="tei tei-ref">191</a>, note); ι᾽ appears to be Act. 7. Of those in the
possession of individuals in Stephen's time, Bp. Marsh (who in
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Letters to Mr. Archdeacon Travis,”</span> 1795, was led to examine
this subject very carefully) has proved that ιγ᾽ is Act. 9;
Wetstein thought θ᾽ was Evan. 38 (which however see); Scholz
seems to approve of Wetstein's conjecture which Griesbach
doubted (N. T., Proleg., Sect. 1. p. xxxviii), that ιβ᾽ is Evan. 9:
Griesbach rightly considers ιδ᾽ to be Evan. 120; ιε᾽ was seen by
Le Long to be Act. 10: these last four are now in the Royal
Library. It has proved the more difficult to settle them, as
Robert Stephen did not even print all the materials that Henry
had gathered; many of whose various readings were published
subsequently by Beza<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> from the collator's own manuscript,
which itself must have been very defective. With all its faults,
however, the edition of 1550 was a foundation on which others
might hereafter build, and was unquestionably of great use in
directing the attention of students to the authorities on which
alone the true text of Scripture is based. This standard edition
contains the following supplementary matter besides the Epistle
to the reader: Chrysostom's Hom. I in S. Matthaeum (then first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Chrysostom's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prol.</span></span> on the Pauline Epistles begins the new
volume. Each separate Epistle has prefixed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prol.</span></span> (chiefly by
Theodoret) and κεφ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t.</span></span> The Acts and Epistles have κεφ., but

R. Stephen's smaller edition (16mo), published in 1551 at

5. Theodore de Bèze [1519-1605], a native of Vezelai in the
Nivernois, after a licentious youth, resigned his ecclesiastical
preferments at the age of twenty-nine to retire with the wife of
his early choice to Geneva, that little city to which the genius
of one man has given so prominent a place in the history of the
sixteenth century. His noble birth and knowledge of the world,
aided by the impression produced at the Conference at Poissy
(1561) by his eloquence and learning, easily gained for Beza the
chief place among the French Reformed on the death of their
teacher Calvin in 1564. Of his services in connexion with the
two Codd. D we have already spoken: he himself put forth at
intervals, besides his own elegant Latin version published in
1556, ten editions of the N. T. (viz. four in folio in the years 1565,
1582, 1588, 1598, and six in octavo in 1565, 1567, 1580, 1591,
1604, and 1611), the Latin Vulgate, and Annotations<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>. A better
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commentator perhaps than a critic, but most conspicuous as the
earnest leader of a religious party, Beza neither sought very
anxiously after fresh materials for correcting the text, nor made
any great use of what were ready at hand, namely, his own two
great codices, the papers of Henry Stephen, and Tremellius' Latin
version of the Peshitto. All his editions vary somewhat from
Stephen and from each other, yet there is no material difference
between any of them<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a>. He exhibits a tendency, not the less
blameworthy because his extreme theological views would tempt
him thereto, towards choosing that reading out of several which
might best suit his own preconceived opinions. Thus in Luke ii.
22 he adopts (and our Authorized English version condescends to
follow his judgement) τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ αὐτῆς from the Complutensian,
for which he could have known of no manuscript authority
whatever: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ejus</span></span> of the Vulgate would most naturally be rendered
by αὐτοῦ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Campbell in loc.). Wetstein calculates that Beza's
text differs from Stephen's in some fifty places (an estimate we
shall find below the mark), and that either in his translation or
his Annotations he departs from Stephen's Greek text in 150
passages (Wetst. N. T., Proleg., Tom. ii. p. 7).

6. The brothers Bonaventure and Abraham Elzevir set up
a printing-press at Leyden, which maintained its reputation for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
elegance and correctness throughout the greater part of the
seventeenth century. One of their minute editions, so much
prized by bibliomanists, was a Greek Testament, 24mo, 1624,
alleging on the title-page (there is no Preface whatever) to be ex
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Regiis aliisque optimis editionibus cum curâ expressum</span></span>: by
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Regiis</span></span>, we presume, Stephen's editions are meant, and especially
that of 1550. The supposed accuracy (for which its good name
is not quite deserved) and the great neatness of this little book
procured for it much popularity. When the edition was exhausted,
a second appeared in 1633, having the verses broken up
into separate sentences, instead of their numbers being indicated
in the margin, as in 1624. In the Preface it seems to allude to
Beza's N. T., without directly naming him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ex regiis ac <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ceteris
editionibus</span></em>, quae maxime ac prae ceteris nunc omnibus probantur.”</span>
To this edition is prefixed, as in 1624, a table of quotations
(πίναξ μαρτυριῶν) from the Old Testament, to which are now
added tables of the κεφάλαια of the Gospels, ἔκθεσις κεφαλαίων of
the Acts and all the Epistles. Of the person entrusted with its
superintendence we know nothing; nearly all his readings are
found either in Stephen's or Beza's N. T. (he leans to the latter
in preference<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>); but he speaks of the edition of 1624 as that
<span class="tei tei-q">“omnibus acceptam;”</span> and boldly states, with a confidence which
no doubt helped on its own accomplishment, <span class="tei tei-q">“textum ergo habes
nunc ab omnibus receptum, in quo nihil immutatum aut corruptum
damus.”</span> His other profession, that of superior correctness,
is also a little premature: <span class="tei tei-q">“ut si quae vel minutissimae in nostro,
aut in iis, quos secuti sumus libris, superessent mendae, cum
judicio ac cura tollerentur.”</span> Although some of the worst misprints
of the edition of 1624 are amended in that of 1633 (Matt.
vi. 34; Acts xxvii. 13; 1 Cor. x. 10; Col. ii. 13; 1 Thess. ii. 17;
Heb. viii. 9; 2 Pet. i. 7), others just as gross are retained (Acts
ix. 3; Rom. vii. 2; xiii. 5; 1 Cor. xii. 23; xiii. 3; 2 Cor. iv. 4;
v. 19; viii. 8; Heb. xii. 9; Apoc. iii. 12; vii. 7; xviii. 16), to
which much be added a few peculiar to itself (e.g. Mark iii. 10;
Rom. xv. 3; 1 Cor. ix. 2; 2 Cor. i. 11; vi. 16; Col. i. 7; iv. 7;
Apoc. xxii. 3): ἐθύθη in 1 Cor. v. 7 should not be reckoned as an

erratum, since it was adopted designedly by Beza, and after him
by both the Elzevir editions. Of real various readings between
the two Elzevirs we mark but seven or eight instances (in
six of which that of 1633 follows the Complutensian); viz.
Mark iv. 18; viii. 24; Luke xi. 33; xii. 20; John iii. 6 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></span>;

The Science of Sacred Textual Criticism was built up in
successive Critical Editions of the Greek Testament, and to
a brief description of those this chapter will be devoted. It will
not include therefore any notice of editions like that of Valpy,
or of Bloomfield, or Alford, or Wordsworth, in which the textual
treatment did not assume prominence or involve advancement
in this province. Still less is there space for such a list of
general editions of the New Testament as the very valuable one
compiled by Dr. Isaac H. Hall, and found in Schaffs <span class="tei tei-q">“Companion
to the New Testament,”</span> to which notice has been already directed.
The progress of Textual Science has involved two chief stages;
the first, in which all evidence was accepted and registered,
and the second, when a selection was made and the rest either
partially or totally disregarded. Lachmann was the leader
in the second stage, of which to some extent Griesbach was
the pioneer. It is evident that in the future a return must be
made, as has been already advocated by many, to the principles
of the first stage<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>.

1. R. Stephen was the first to bring together any considerable
body of manuscript evidence, however negligently or capriciously
he may have applied it to the emendation of the sacred text.
A succession of English scholars was now ready to follow him in
the same path, the only direct and sure one in criticism; and for
about eighty years our countrymen maintained the foremost
place in this important branch of Biblical learning. Their van
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was led by Brian Walton [1600-61], afterwards Bishop of
Chester, who published in 1657 the London Polyglott, which he
had planned twelve years before, as at once the solace and meet
employment of himself and a worthy band of colleagues during
that sad season when Christ's Church in England was for a while
trodden in the dust, and its ministers languished in silence and
deep poverty. The fifth of his huge folios was devoted to the
New Testament in six languages, viz. Stephen's Greek text of
1550<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a>, the Peshitto-Syriac, the Latin Vulgate, the Ethiopic,
Arabic, and (in the Gospels only) the Persic. The exclusively
critical apparatus, with which alone we are concerned, consists
of the readings of Cod. A set at the foot of the Greek text,
and, in the sixth or supplementary volume, of Lucas Brugensis'
notes on various readings of the Gospels in Greek and Latin;
of those given by the Louvain divines in their edition of the
Vulgate (Walton, Polygl., Tom. vi. No. xvii); and especially
of a collation of sixteen authorities, whereof all but three, viz.
Nos. 1, 15, 16<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a>, had never been used before (Walton, Tom. vi.
No. xvi). These various readings had been gathered by the
care and diligence of Archbishop Ussher [1580-1656], then
living in studious and devout retirement near London<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>. They

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the margin of a Bible printed at Frankfort, 1597, by the
heirs of And. Wechel. It is indifferent whether they be
referred to Francis Junius or F. Sylburg as editors, since all
the readings in the New Testament are found in Stephen's
margin, or in the early editions.

Walton was thus enabled to publish very extensive additions
to the existing stock of materials. That he did not try by their
means to form thus early a corrected text, is not at all to be
regretted; the time for that attempt was not yet arrived. He
cannot, however, be absolved from the charge to which R. Stephen
had been before amenable, of suppressing a large portion of
the collations which had been sent him. The Rev. C. B. Scott,
Head Master of Westminster School, found in the Library of
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, the readings of Codd. D. 59, 61,
62, prepared for Walton (Dobbin, Cod. Montfort., Introd. p. 21),
which Mill had access to, and in his N. T. made good use of, as
well as of Ussher's other papers (Mill, Proleg. § 1505).

2. Steph. Curcellaeus or Courcelles published his N. T. at
Amsterdam in 1658, before he had seen Walton's Polyglott.
The peculiar merit of his book arises from his marginal collection
of parallel texts, which are more copious than those of his
predecessors, yet not too many for convenient use: later editors
have been thankful to take them as a basis for their own<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a>.

manuscripts) at the foot of each page, or thrown into an
appendix, mingled with certain rash conjectures which betray
a Socinian bias: but since the authorities are not cited for
each separate reading, these critical labours were as good as
wasted<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a>.

3. A more important step in advance was taken in the Greek
Testament in 8vo, issued from the Oxford University Press in
1675. This elegant volume (whose Greek text is mainly that of
Elzevir 1633<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>) was superintended by John Fell [1625-86], Dean
of Christ Church, soon afterwards Bishop of Oxford, the biographer
of saint-like Hammond, himself one of the most learned
and munificent, if not quite the most popular Prelate, of that
golden age of the English Church, in whose behalf Anthony
à Wood designates him <span class="tei tei-q">“the most zealous man of his time.”</span> His
brief yet interesting Preface not only discusses the causes of
various readings<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>, and describes the materials used for his
edition, but touches on that weak and ignorant prejudice which
had been already raised against the collection of such variations
in the text of Scripture; and that too sometimes by persons like
John Owen<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> the Puritan, intrusive Dean of Christ Church under
Cromwell, who, but that we are loth to doubt his integrity,
would hardly be deemed a victim of the panic he sought to
spread. In reply to all objectors the Bishop pleads the comparative
insignificance of the change produced by various
readings in the general sense of Holy Writ, and especially urges
that God hath dealt so bountifully with His people <span class="tei tei-q">“ut necessaria
quaeque et ad salutis summam facientia in S. literis saepius repeterentur;
ita ut si forte quidpiam minus commode alicubi
expressum, id damnum aliunde reparari possit”</span> (Praef. p. 1).
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
On this assurance we may well rest in peace. This edition is
more valuable for the impulse it gave to subsequent investigators
than for the richness of its own stores of fresh materials, although
it is stated on the title-page to be derived <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex plus</span></span> 100 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">MSS.
Codicibus</span></span>.”</span> Patristic testimony, as we have seen, Bishop Fell
rather undervalued: the use of versions he clearly perceived,
yet of those at that time available, he only attends to the
Gothic and Coptic as revised by Marshall: his list of manuscripts
hitherto untouched is very scanty. To those used by
Walton we can add only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">R</span></span>, the Barberini readings, then just
published (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg210" class="tei tei-ref">210</a>); <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>, twelve Bodleian codices <span class="tei tei-q">“quorum
plerique intacti prius,”</span> in no-wise described, and cited only by
the number of them which may countenance each variation;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">U</span></span>, the two Ussher manuscripts Evan. 63, 64 as collated by
H. Dodwell; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">P</span></span>, three copies from the Library of Petavius
(Act. 38, 39, 40); <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ge.</span></span>, another from St. Germains (Paul. E):
the readings of the last four were furnished by Joh. Gachon.
Yet this slight volume (for so we must needs regard it)
was the legitimate parent of one of the noblest works in
the whole range of Biblical literature, of which we shall speak
next.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Novum Testamentum Graecum</span></span> of Dr. John Mill, Oxford,
1707, in folio. This able and laborious critic, born in 1645,
quitted his native village in Westmoreland at sixteen for Queen's
College, Oxford, of which society he became a Fellow, and was
conspicuous there both as a scholar and as a ready extemporary
preacher. In 1685 his College appointed him Principal of its
affiliated Hall, St. Edmund, so honourably distinguished for the
Biblical studies of its members; but Mill had by that time made
good progress in his Greek Testament, on which he gladly spent
the last thirty years of his life, dying suddenly in 1707, a fortnight
after its publication. His attention was first called to the
subject by his friend, Dr. Edward Bernard, the Savilian Professor
at Oxford, whom he vividly represents as setting before him an
outline of the work, and encouraging him to attempt its accomplishment.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Vides, Amice mi, opus ... omnium, mihi crede,
longè dignissimum, cui in hoc aetatis tuae flore, robur animi
tui, vigilias ac studia, liberaliter impendas”</span> (Proleg. § 1417).
Ignorant as yet both of the magnitude and difficulty of his task,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mill boldly undertook it about 1677, and his efforts soon
obtained the countenance of Bishop Fell, who promised to defray
the expense of printing, and, mindful of the frailty of life, urged
him to go to press before his papers were quite ready to meet
the public eye. When about twenty-four chapters of St. Matthew
had been completed, Bishop Fell died prematurely in 1686, and
the book seems to have languished for many following years
from lack of means, though the editor was busy all the while in
gathering and arranging his materials, especially for the Prolegomena,
which well deserve to be called <span class="tei tei-q">“marmore perenniora.”</span>
As late as 1704 John Sharp [1644-1714], Archbishop of York,
whose remonstrances to Queen Anne some years subsequently
hindered the ribald wit that wrote <span class="tei tei-q">“A Tale of a Tub”</span> from
polluting the episcopal throne of an English see, obtained from
her for Mill a stall at Canterbury, and the royal command to
prosecute his New Testament forthwith. The preferment came
just in time. Three years afterwards the volume was given to
the Christian world, and its author's course was already
finished: his life's work well ended, he had entered upon his
rest. He was spared the pain of reading the unfair attack alike
on his book and its subject by our eminent Commentator, Daniel
Whitby (<span class="tei tei-q">“Examen Variantium Lectionum,”</span> 1710), and of witnessing
the unscrupulous use of Whitby's arguments made by the
sceptic Anthony Collins in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Discourse of Free Thinking,”</span>
1713.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Mill's services to Biblical criticism surpass in extent and
value those rendered by any other, except perhaps one or two
men of our own time. A large proportion of his care and pains,
as we have seen already, was bestowed on the Fathers and
ancient writers of every description who have used or cited
Scripture. The versions are usually considered his weakest
point, although he first accorded to the Vulgate and to its prototype
the Old Latin the importance they deserve. His knowledge
of Syriac was rather slight, and for the other Eastern tongues,
if he was not more ignorant than his successors, he had not
discovered how little Latin translations of the Ethiopic, &amp;c., can
be trusted. As a collator of manuscripts the list subjoined will
bear full testimony to his industry: without seeking to repeat
details we have entered into before under the Cursive MSS., it is
right to state that he either himself re-examined, or otherwise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
represented more fully and exactly, the codices that had been
previously used for the London Polyglott and the Oxford N. T.
of 1675. Still it would be wrong to dissemble the fact that
Mill's style of collation is not such as the strictness of modern
scholarship demands. He seldom notices at all such various
readings as arise from the transposition of words, the insertion
or omission of the Greek article, from homoeoteleuta, or itacisms,
or from manifest errors of the pen; while in respect to general
accuracy he is as much inferior to those who have trod in his
steps, as he rises above Stephen and Ussher, or the persons
employed by Walton and Fell. It has been my fortune to
collate not a few manuscripts after this great critic, and I have
elsewhere been obliged to notice these plain facts, I would fain
trust in no disparaging temper. During the many years that
Mill's N. T. has been my daily companion, my reverence for that
diligent and earnest man has been constantly growing: the
principles of internal evidence which guided his choice between
conflicting authorities were simple (as indeed they ought to be),
but applied with rare judgement, sagacity, and moderation:
his zeal was unflagging, his treatment of his sacred subject
deeply reverential. Of the criticism of the New Testament in
the hands of Dr. John Mill it may be said, that he found the
edifice of wood, and left it marble.

The Prolegomena of Mill, divided into three parts—(1) on
the Canon of the New Testament; (2) on the History of the
Text, including the quotations of the Fathers and the early
editions; and (3) on the plan and contents of his own work,—though
by this time too far behind the present state of knowledge
to bear reprinting, comprise a monument of learning such as the
world has seldom seen, and contain much information the student
will not even now easily find elsewhere. Although Mill perpetually
pronounces his judgement on the character of disputed
readings<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>, especially in his Prolegomena, which were printed long

In 1710 Ludolph Kuster, a Westphalian, republished Mill's

Greek Testament, in folio, at Amsterdam and Rotterdam (or with
a new title page, Leipsic, 1723, Amsterdam, 1746), arranging in its
proper place the matter cast by Mill into his Appendix, as having
reached him too late to stand in his critical notes, and adding to
those notes the readings of twelve fresh manuscripts, one collated
by Kuster himself, which he describes in a Preface well worth
reading. Nine of these codices collated by, or under, the Abbé
de Louvois are in the Royal Library at Paris (viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paris.</span></span> 1,

5. In the next year after Kuster's Mill (1711), appeared at
Amsterdam, from the press of the Wetsteins, a small N. T.,
8vo, containing all the critical matter of the Oxford edition of
1675, a collation of one Vienna manuscript (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caes.</span></span> = Evan. 76), 43
canons <span class="tei tei-q">“secundum quos variantes lectiones N. T. examinandae,”</span>
and discussions upon them, with other matter, especially parallel
texts, forming a convenient manual, the whole by G. D. T. M. D.,
which being interpreted means Gerhard de Trajecto Mosae Doctor,
this Gerhard von Mästricht being a Syndic of Bremen. The text
is Fell's, except in Apoc. iii. 12, where the portentous erratum
λαῷ for ναῷ of Stephen is corrected. A second and somewhat
improved edition was published in 1735, but ere that date the
book must have become quite superseded.

6. We have to return to England once more, where the criticism
of the New Testament had engrossed the attention of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Richard Bentley</span></span> [1662-1742], whose elevation to the enviable
post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1699, was a just
recognition of his supremacy in the English world of letters.
As early as 1691 he had felt a keen interest in sacred criticism,
and in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Epistola ad Johannem Millium”</span> had urged that
editor, in language fraught with eloquence and native vigour, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hasten on the work (whose accomplishment was eventually
left to others) of publishing side by side on the opened leaf
Codd. A, D (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bezae</span></span>), D (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clarom.</span></span>), E (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Laud.</span></span>). For many years
afterwards Bentley's laurels were won on other fields, and it was
not till his friend was dead, and his admirable labours were
exposed to the obloquy of opponents (some honest though
unwise, others hating Mill because they hated the Scriptures
which he sought to illustrate), that our Aristarchus exerted
his giant strength to crush the infidel and to put the ignorant
to silence. In his <span class="tei tei-q">“Remarks upon a late Discourse of Free
Thinking in a letter to F[rancis] H[are] D.D. by Phileleutherus
Lipsiensis,”</span> 1713, Bentley displayed that intimate familiarity
with the whole subject of various readings, their causes, extent,
and consequences, which has rendered this occasional treatise
more truly valued (as it was far more important) than the
world-renowned <span class="tei tei-q">“Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris”</span>
itself. As his years were now hastening on and the evening
of life was beginning to draw nigh, it was seemly that the first
scholar of his age should seek for his rare abilities an employment
more entirely suited to his sacred office than even the
most successful cultivation of classical learning; and so, about
this time, he came to project what he henceforth regarded
as his greatest effort, an edition of the Greek New Testament.
In 1716 we find him in conference with J. J. Wetstein, then
very young, and seeking his aid in procuring collations.
In the same year he addressed his memorable <span class="tei tei-q">“Letter”</span> to
Wm. Wake [1657-1737], Archbishop of Canterbury, whose
own mind was full of the subject, wherein he explains, with
characteristic energy and precision, the principles on which he
proposed to execute his great scheme. As these principles must
be reviewed afterwards, we will but touch upon them now.
His theory was built upon the notion that the oldest manuscripts
of the Greek original and of Jerome's Latin version resemble
each other so marvellously, even in the very order of the words,
that by this agreement he could restore the text as it stood in
the fourth century, <span class="tei tei-q">“so that there shall not be twenty words, or
even particles, difference.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“By taking two thousand errors out
of the Pope's [i.e. the Clementine] Vulgate, and as many out of
the Protestant Pope Stephen's [1550], I can set out an edition of
each in columns, without using any book under nine hundred
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
years old, that shall so exactly agree word for word, and, what
at first amazed me, order for order, that no two tallies, nor two
indentures, can agree better<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a>.”</span> In 1720, some progress having
been made in the task of collation, chiefly at Paris, by John
Walker, Fellow of Trinity, who was designated by Bentley
<span class="tei tei-q">“overseer and corrector of the press,”</span> but proved in fact a great
deal more; Bentley published his Proposals for Printing<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a>, a work
which <span class="tei tei-q">“he consecrates, as a κειμήλιων, a κτῆμα ἐσαεί, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">charter</span></em>,
a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magna charta</span></span>, to the whole Christian Church; to last when
all the ancient MSS. here quoted may be lost and extinguished.”</span>
Alas for the emptiness of human anticipations! Of this noble
design, projected by one of the most diligent, by one of the most
highly gifted men our dear mother Cambridge ever nourished,
nothing now remains but a few scattered notices in treatises on
Textual Criticism, and large undigested stores of various readings
and random observations, accumulated in his College Library;
papers which no real student ever glanced through, but with
a heart saddened—almost sickened—at the sight of so much
labour lost<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>. The specimen chapter (Apocalypse xxii) which
accompanied his Proposals shows clearly how little had yet been
done towards arranging the materials that had been collected;
codices are cited there, and in many of his loose notes, not
separately and by name, as in Mill's volume, but mostly as
<span class="tei tei-q">“Anglicus unus, tres codd. veterrimi, Gall. quatuor, Germ. unus,”</span>
&amp;c., in the rough fashion of the Oxford N. T. of 1675<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been often alleged that Bentley seems to have worked
but little on the Greek Testament after 1729: that his attention
was diverted by his editions of Paradise Lost (1732) and of
Manilius (1739), by his Homeric studies and College litigation,
until he was overtaken by a paralytic stroke in 1739, and died
in his eighty-first year in 1742. Walker's collations of cursive
manuscripts at Christ Church (Evan. 506), however, obviously
made for Bentley's use, bear the date of 1732<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a>, and a closer
examination of his papers, bequeathed in 1786 by his nephew
Richard Bentley to Trinity College, shows that much more
progress had been made by him than has been usually supposed.
Besides full collations of the uncial Codd. AD (Gospels and Acts),
of Cod. F (his θ) and G of St. Paul, of Arundel 547 (Evst. 257)
executed by Bentley himself, of Codd. B and C by others at
his cost, three volumes are found there full of critical materials,
which have been described by Mr. Ellis, and digested by Dr.
Westcott. One of these (B. xvii. 5) I was allowed by the
Master and Seniors to study at leisure at home. It is a folio
edition of the N. T., Greek and Latin (Paris, ap. Claud. Sonnium,
1628, the Greek text being that of Elzevir 1624), whose margin
and spaces between the lines are filled with various readings in
Bentley's hand, but not all of them necessarily the results of his
own labour, collected out of ten Greek and thirty Latin
manuscripts. The Greek are all cursives save Evst. 5, and his
connexion with them has been referred to above under the
Cursive MSS. They are

A second mass of materials, all Latin, about twenty in
number, and deposited in England, is contained in the first
volume of the Benedictine edition of St. Jerome's works (Paris,

These, of course, are no more than the rough materials of
criticism. Another copy of the N. T. has been carefully and
curiously made available for my use by the goodness of my
friend Edwin Palmer, D.D., Archdeacon of Oxford. It is numbered
B. xvii. 6, and is a duplicate copy (without its title-page) of
the same printed book as B. xvii. 5. It is interleaved throughout,
and was prepared very early in the course of this undertaking,
inasmuch as Bentley describes it in an undated letter to Wetstein,
which the latter answered Nov. 3, 1716. In the printed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
text itself, both Greek and Latin, as they stand in parallel
columns, Bentley makes the corrections which he at that period
was willing to adopt. There is no critical apparatus to justify
his changes in the Latin version, but on the blank leaves of
the book he sets down his Greek authorities, always cited
by name, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alex.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cant.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rom.</span></span> (Cod. B.), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ox.</span></span> in the Acts
(Cod. E), θ in St. Paul for Cod. Augiensis (F), though this last
did not reach him before 1718. Cod. C is sometimes called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eph.</span></span>, sometimes it is mixed up with Wetstein's other copies
(1 Wetstein, 2 Wetstein, &amp;c.). This most interesting volume,
therefore, contains the first draft of Bentley's great design,
and must have been nearly in its present state when the 'Proposals'
were published in 1720, since the specimen chapter
(Apoc. xxii) which accompanied them is taken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verbatim</span></span> from
B. xvii. 6, save that authorities are added to vindicate the
alterations of the Latin text, which is destitute of them in
the printed book. Mr. Ellis too has printed the Epistle to the
Galatians from the same source, and this specimen also produces
much the same impression of meagreness and imperfection. It
was doubtless in some degree to remedy an apparent crudeness
that cursive copies were afterwards called in, as in B. xvii. 5 and
in Walker's Oxford collections. The fact is that Bentley's main
principle, as set forth by him from 1716 to 1720, that of substantial
identity between the oldest Greek and Latin copies, is
more favoured by Cod. A, which he knew soonest and best, than
by any other really ancient documents, least of all by Cod. B,
with which he obtained fuller acquaintance in or about 1720.
Our Aristarchus then betook himself at intervals to cursive
codices in the vain hope of getting aid from them, and so lost his
way at last in that wide and pathless wilderness. We cannot
but believe that nothing less than the manifest impossibility of
maintaining the principles which his <span class="tei tei-q">“Letter”</span> of 1716 enunciated,
and his 'Proposals' of 1720 scarcely modified, in the face of the
evidence which his growing mass of collations bore against
them<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>, could have had power enough to break off in the midst

8. The New Testament of John Albert Bengel, 4to, Tübingen,
1734<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>: his <span class="tei tei-q">“Prodromus N. T. Gr. rectè cautèque adornandi”</span> had
appeared as early as 1725. This devout and truly able man
[1687-1752], who held the office (whatever might be its functions)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Abbot of Alpirspach in the Lutheran communion of
Württemberg, though more generally known as an interpreter of
Scripture from his invaluable <span class="tei tei-q">“Gnomon Novi Testamenti,”</span> yet
left the stamp of his mind deeply imprinted on the criticism of
the sacred volume. As a collator his merits were not high;
nearly all his sixteen codices have required and obtained fresh
examination from those who came after him<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>. His text, which
he arranged in convenient paragraphs, as has been said, is the
earliest important specimen of intentional departure from the
received type; hence he imposes on himself the strange restriction
of admitting into it no reading (excepting in the Apocalypse)
which had not appeared in one or more of the editions that
preceded his own. He pronounces his opinion on other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">select</span></em>
variations by placing them in his lower margin with Greek
numerals attached to them, according as he judged them decidedly
better (α), or somewhat more likely (β), than those which
stand in his text: or equal to them (γ); or a little (δ), or considerably
(ε), inferior. This notation has advantages which
might well have commended it to the attention of succeeding
editors. In his <span class="tei tei-q">“Apparatus Criticus”</span> also, at the end of his
volume, he set the example, now generally followed, of recording
definitely the testimony in favour of a received reading, as well
as that against it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the peculiar importance of Bengel's N. T. is due to the
critical principles developed therein. Not only was his native
acuteness of great service to him, when weighing the conflicting
probabilities of internal evidence, but in his fertile mind
sprang up the germ of that theory of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">families</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recensions</span></em>,
which was afterwards expanded by J. S. Semler [1725-91],
and grew to such formidable dimensions in the skilful
hands of Griesbach. An attentive student of the discrepant
readings of the N. T., even in the limited extent they had
hitherto been collected, could hardly fail to discern that certain
manuscripts, versions, and ecclesiastical writers have a manifest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
affinity with each other; so that one of them shall seldom
be cited in support of a variation (not being a manifest and
gross error of the copyist), unless accompanied by several of
its kindred. The inference is direct and clear, that documents
which thus withdraw themselves from the general mass of authorities,
must have sprung from some common source, distinct
from those which in characteristic readings they but slightly
resemble. It occurred, therefore, to Bengel as a hopeful mode
of making good progress in the criticism of the N. T., to reduce
all extant testimony into <span class="tei tei-q">“companies, families, tribes, and
nations,”</span> and thus to simplify the process of settling the sacred
text by setting class over against class, and trying to estimate
the genius of each, and the relative importance they may severally
lay claim to. He wished to divide all extant documents
into two nations: the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Asiatic</span></span>, chiefly written in Constantinople
and its neighbourhood, which he was inclined to disparage; and
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">African</span></span>, comprising the few of a better type (<span class="tei tei-q">“Apparatus
Criticus,”</span> p. 669, 2nd edition, 1763). Various circumstances
hindered Bengel from working out his principle, among which
he condescends to set his dread of exposing his task to senseless
ridicule<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a>; yet no one can doubt that it comprehends the elements
of what is both reasonable and true; however difficult
it has subsequently proved to adjust the details of any consistent
scheme. For the rest, Bengel's critical verdicts, always
considered in relation to his age and opportunities, deserve
strong commendation. He saw the paramount worth of Cod. A,
the only great uncial then much known (N. T., Apparat. Crit.,
pp. 390-401). The high character of the Latin version, and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessity for revising its text by means of manuscripts (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>,
p. 391), he readily conceded, after Bentley's example. His
mean estimate of the Greek-Latin codices (Evan. Act. D; Act. E;
Paul. DFG) may not find equal favour in the eyes of all his
admirers; he pronounces them <span class="tei tei-q">“re verâ bilingues;”</span> which, for
their perpetual and wilful interpolations, <span class="tei tei-q">“non pro codicibus sed
pro rhapsodiis, haberi debeant”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>, p. 386)<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. The next step in advance was made by John James
Wetstein [1693-1754], a native of Basle, whose edition of the
Greek New Testament (<span class="tei tei-q">“cum lectionibus variantibus Codicum
MSS., Editionum aliarum, Versionum et Patrum, necnon Commentario
pleniore ex scriptoribus veteribus, Hebraeis, Graecis,
et Latinis, historiam et vim verborum illustrante”</span>) appeared in
two volumes, folio, Amsterdam, 1751-2. The genius, the character,
and (it must in justice be added) the worldly fortunes
of Wetstein were widely different from those of the good Abbot
of Alpirspach. His taste for Biblical studies showed itself early.
When ordained pastor at the age of twenty he delivered a
disputation, <span class="tei tei-q">“De variis N. T. lectionibus,”</span> and zeal for this
fascinating pursuit became at length with him a passion—the
master-passion which consoled and dignified a roving, troubled,
unprosperous life. In 1714 his eager search for manuscripts
led him to Paris, in 1715-16 and again in 1720 he visited
England, and was employed by Bentley in collecting materials
for his projected edition, but he seems to have imbibed few
of that great man's principles: the interval between them,
both in age and station, almost forbade much sympathy. On
his return home he gradually became suspected of Socinian
tendencies, and it must be feared with too much justice; so
that in the end he was deposed from the pastorate (1730), driven
into exile, and after having been compelled to serve in a position
the least favourable to the cultivation of learning, that of a
military chaplain, he obtained at length (1733) a Professorship
among the Remonstrants at Amsterdam (in succession to the
celebrated Leclerc), and there continued till his death in 1754,
having made his third visit to England in 1746. His <span class="tei tei-q">“Prolegomena,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
first published in 1730, and afterwards, in an altered
form, prefixed to his N. T.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a>, present a painful image both of
the man and of his circumstances. His restless energy, his
undaunted industry, his violent temper, his love of paradox,
his assertion for himself of perfect freedom of thought, his silly
prejudice against Jesuits and bigots, his enmities, his wrongs,
his ill-requited labours, at once excite our respect and our pity:
while they all help to make his writings a sort of unconscious
autobiography, rather interesting than agreeable. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non sic itur
ad astra</span></span>, whether morally or intellectually; yet Wetstein's
services to sacred literature were of no common order. His
philological annotations, wherein the matter and phraseology
of the inspired writers are illustrated by copious—too copious—quotations
from all kinds of authors, classical, Patristic, and
Rabbinical, have proved an inexhaustible storehouse from which
later writers have drawn liberally and sometimes without due
acknowledgement; but many of the passages are of such a
tenor as (to use Tregelles' very gentle language respecting them)
<span class="tei tei-q">“only to excite surprise at their being found on the same
page as the text of the New Testament”</span> (Account of Printed
Text, p. 76). The critical portion of his work, however, is
far more valuable, and in this department Wetstein must be
placed in the very first rank, inferior (if to any) to but one or
two of the highest names. He first cited the manuscripts
under the notation by which they are commonly known, his
list already embracing A-O, 1-112 of the Gospels; A-G,
1-58 of the Acts; A-H, 1-60 of St. Paul; A-C, 1-28 of
the Apocalypse; 1-24 Evangelistaria; 1-4 of the Apostolos.
Of these Wetstein himself collated about one hundred and
two<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a>; if not as fully or accurately as is now expected, yet with
far greater care than had hitherto been usual: about eleven were
examined for him by other hands. On the versions and early
editions he has likewise bestowed great pains; and he improved
upon quotations from the Fathers. His text is that of Elzevir
(1633), not very exactly printed<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>, and immediately below it he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
placed such readings of his manuscripts as he judged preferable
to those received. The readings thus approved by Wetstein
(which do not amount to five hundred, and those chiefly in the
Apocalypse) were inserted in the text of a Greek Testament
published in London, 1763, 2 vols., by W. Bowyer, the learned
printer, with a collection of critical conjectures annexed, which
were afterwards published separately.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wetstein's Prolegomena have also been reproduced by J. S.
Semler (Halle, 1764), with good notes and facsimiles of certain
manuscripts, and more recently, in a compressed and modernized
form, by J. A. Lotze (Rotterdam, 1831), a book which neither
for design nor execution can be much praised. The truth is that
both the style and the subject-matter of much that Wetstein
wrote are things of the past. In his earlier edition of his Prolegomena
(1730) he had spoken of the oldest Greek uncial copies
as they deserve; he was even disposed to take Cod. A as the
basis of his text. By the time his N. T. was ready, twenty years
later, he had come to include it, with all the older codices of the
original, under a general charge of being conformed to the Latin
version. That such a tendency may be detected in some of the
codices accompanied by a Latin translation, is both possible
in itself, and not inconsistent with their general spirit; but
he has scattered abroad his imputations capriciously and
almost at random, so as greatly to diminish the weight of his
own decisions. Cod. A, in particular, has been fully cleared of
the charge of Latinizing by Woide, in his excellent Prolegomena
(§ 6). His thorough contempt for that critic prevented
Wetstein from giving adequate attention to Bengel's theory of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
families; indeed he can hardly be said to have rejected a scheme
which he scorned to investigate with patience. On the other
hand no portion of his labours is more valuable than the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Animadversiones et Cautiones ad examen variarum lectionum
N. T. necessariae”</span> (N. T., Tom. ii. pp. 851-74). In this tract
his natural good sense and extensive knowledge of authorities
of every class have gone far to correct that impetuous temperament
which was ever too ready to substitute plausible conjecture
in the room of ascertained facts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the twenty years immediately ensuing on the publication
of Wetstein's volumes, little was attempted in the way
of enlarging or improving the domain he had secured for Biblical
science. In England the attention of students was directed, and on
the whole successfully, to the criticism of the Hebrew Scriptures;
in Germany, the younger (J. D.) Michaelis [1717-91] reigned
supreme, and he seems to have deemed it the highest effort of
scholarship to sit in judgement on the labours of others. In
process of time, however, the researches of John James Griesbach
[1745-1812], a native of Hesse Darmstadt and a pupil of Semler,
and J. A. Ernesti [1707-81] (whose manual, <span class="tei tei-q">“Institutio Interpretis
N. T.,”</span> 1761, has not long been superseded), began to attract
general notice. Like Wetstein, he made a literary tour in England
early in life (1769), and with far more profit; returning to
Halle as a Professor, he published before he was thirty (1774-5)
his first edition of the N. T., which contained the well-defined
embryo of his future and more elaborate speculations. It will
be convenient to reserve the examination of his views until
we have described the investigations of several collators who
unknowingly (and in one instance, no doubt unwillingly)
were busy in gathering stores which he was to turn to his
own use.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Christian Frederick Matthaei, a Thuringian [1744-1811],
was appointed, on the recommendation of his tutor Ernesti, to
the Professorship of Classical Literature at Moscow: so far as
philology is concerned, he probably merited Bp. Middleton's
praise, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the most accurate scholar who ever edited the N. T.”</span>
(Doctrine of the Greek Article, p. 244, 3rd edition.) At Moscow
he found a large number of Greek manuscripts, both Biblical
and Patristic, originally brought from Athos, quite uncollated,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and almost entirely unknown in the west of Europe. With
laudable resolution he set himself to examine them, and
gradually formed the scheme of publishing an edition of the
New Testament by the aid of materials so precious and
abundant. All authors that deserve that honourable name may
be presumed to learn not a little, even on the subject they know
best, while preparing an important work for the public eye; but
Matthaei was as yet ignorant of the first principles of the critical
art; and beginning thus late, there was much, and that of a very
elementary character, which he never understood at all. When
he commenced writing he had not seen the volumes of Mill or
Wetstein; and to this significant fact we must impute that
inability which clave to him to the last, of discriminating the
relative age and value of his own or others' codices. The
palaeographical portion of the science, indeed, he gradually
acquired from the study of his documents, and through the
many facsimiles of them he represents in his edition; but what
can be thought of his judgement, when he persisted in asserting
the intrinsic superiority of Cod. 69 of the Acts to the great
uncials AC (N. T., Tom. xii. p. 222)<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a>? Hence it results that
Matthaei's text, which of course he moulded on his own views,
must be held in slight esteem: his services as a collator comprehend
his whole claim (and that no trifling one) to our thankful
regard. To him solely we are indebted for Evan. V; 237-259;
Act. 98-107; Paul. 113-124; Apoc. 47-50<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span> (i.e. r); Evst. 47-57;
Apost. 13-20; nearly all at Moscow: the whole seventy<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a>, together
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the citations of Scripture in thirty-four manuscripts of
Chrysostom<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>, being so fully and accurately collated, that the
reader need not be at a loss whether any particular copy
supports or opposes the reading in the common text. Matthaei's
further services in connexion with Cod. G Paul, and
a few others (Act. 69, &amp;c.) have been noticed in their proper
places. To his Greek text was annexed the Latin Vulgate
(the only version, in its present state, he professes to regard,
Tom. xi. p. xii) from the Cod. Demidovianus. The first
volume of this edition appeared in 1782, after it had been
already eight years in preparation: this comprised the Catholic
Epistles. The rest of the work was published at intervals
during the next six years, in eleven more thin parts 8vo, the
whole series being closed by SS. Matthew and Mark in 1788.
Each volume has a Preface, much descriptive matter, and facsimiles
of manuscripts (twenty-nine in all), the whole being in
complete and almost hopeless disorder, and the general title-page
absurdly long. Hence his critical principles (if such they may
be termed) must be picked up piecemeal; and it is not very
pleasant to observe the sort of influence which hostile controversy
exercised over his mind and temper. While yet fresh at his
task (1782), anticipating the fair fame his most profitable
researches had so well earned, Matthaei is frank, calm, and
rational: even at a later period J. D. Michaelis is, in his
estimation, the keenest of living judges of codices, and he says
so the rather <span class="tei tei-q">“quod ille vir doctissimus multis modis me, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quâ
de causâ ipse ignoro</span></em>, partim jocosè, partim seriò, vexavit”</span> (Tom.
ii, 1788, p. xxxi). Bengel, whose sentiments were very dissimilar
from those of the Moscow Professor, <span class="tei tei-q">“pro acumine, diligentiâ et
religione suâ,”</span> would have arrived at other conclusions, had his
Augsburg codices been better (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>, p. xxx). But for Griesbach
and his recension-theory no terms of insult are strong enough;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“risum vel adeo pueris debet ille Halensis criticus,”</span> who never
saw, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ut credibile est</span></em>,”</span> a manuscript even of the tenth century
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>, p. xxiii), yet presumes to dictate to those who have collated
seventy. The unhappy consequence was, that one who had taken
up this employment in an earnest and candid spirit, possessed
with the simple desire to promote the study of sacred literature,
could devise no fitter commencement for his latest Preface
than this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Laborem igitur molestum invidiosum et infamem,
inter convicia ranarum et latratus canum, aut ferreâ patientiâ
aut invictâ pertinaciâ his quindecim annis vel sustinui, vel
utcunque potui perfeci, vel denique et fastidio et taedio, ut
fortasse non nulli opinantur, deposui et abjeci”</span> (Tom. i, Praef.
p. 1): he could find no purer cause for thankfulness, than (what
we might have imagined but a very slight mercy) that he had
never been commended by those <span class="tei tei-q">“of whom to be dispraised is no
small praise;”</span> or (to use his own more vigorous language) <span class="tei tei-q">“quod
nemo scurra ... nemo denique de grego novorum theologorum,
hanc qualemcunque operam meam ausus est ore impuro suo,
laudeque contumeliosâ comprobare.”</span> Matthaei's second edition
in three volumes (destitute of the Latin version and most of the
critical notes) bears date 1803-7<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>. For some cause, now not
easy to understand, he hardly gave to this second edition the
advantages of his studies during the fifteen years which had
elapsed since he completed his first. We saw his labours
bestowed on the Zittau N. T. in 1801-2 (Evan. 605). On the
last leaf of the third volume of his second edition, writing from
Moscow in May, 1805, he speaks of a book containing collations
of no less than twenty-four manuscripts, partly fresh, partly
corrected, which, when he returned into Russia, he delivered to
Augustus Schumann, a bookseller at Ronneburg (in Saxe Altenburg),
to be published in close connexion with his second edition
against the Easter Fair at Leipzig in 1805. Another book
contained extracts from St. Chrysostom with a commentary and
index, to be published at the same time, and both at Schumann's
risk. <span class="tei tei-q">“Utrum isti libri jam prodierint necne,”</span> our author adds
pathetically, <span class="tei tei-q">“nondum factus sum certior. Certe id vehementer
opto.”</span> But in 1805 evil times were hastening upon Germany,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and so unfortunately for the poor man and for textual students
these collections have disappeared and left no trace behind.

10.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span> The next, and a far less considerable contribution to our
knowledge of manuscripts of the N. T., was made by Francis
Karl Alter [1749-1804], a Jesuit, born in Silesia, and Professor
of Greek at Vienna. His plan was novel, and, to those who are
compelled to use his edition (N. T. Graecum, ad Codicem Vindobonensem
Graecè expressum, 8vo, Vienna, 2 tom., 1786-7),
inconvenient to the last degree. Adopting for his standard
a valuable, but not very ancient or remarkable, manuscript in
the Imperial Library (Evan. 218, Act. 65, Paul. 57, Apoc.
83), he prints this copy at full length, retaining even the
ν ἐφελκυστικόν when it is found in his model, but not (as it
would seem) all the itacisms or errors of the scribe, conforming
in such cases to Stephen's edition of 1546. With this text he
collates in separate Appendices twenty-one other manuscripts of
the same great Library, comprising twelve copies of the Gospels
(Codd. N, a fragment, 3, 76, 77, 108, 123, 124, 125, 219, 220, 224,
225); six of the Acts, &amp;c. (3, 43, 63, 64, 66, 67); seven of St. Paul
(3, 49, 67-71); three of the Apocalypse (34, 35, 36), and two
Evangelistaria (45, 46). He also gives readings from Wilkins'
Coptic version, four Slavonic codices and one Old Latin (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span>).
In employing this ill-digested mass, it is necessary to turn
to a different place for every manuscript to be consulted, and
Alter's silence in any passages must be understood to indicate
resemblance to his standard, Evan. 218, and not to the
common text. As this silence is very often clearly due to
the collator's mere oversight, Griesbach set the example of citing
these manuscripts in such cases within marks of parenthesis:
thus <span class="tei tei-q">“218 (108, 220)”</span> indicates that the reading in question is
certainly found in Cod. 218, and (so far as we may infer <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex
Alteri silentio</span></span>) not improbably in the other two. Most of these
Vienna codices were about the same time examined rather
slightly by Andrew Birch.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. This eminent person, who afterwards bore successively
the titles of Bishop of Lolland, Falster, and Aarhuus, in the
Lutheran communion established in Denmark, was one of a company
of learned men sent by the liberal care of Christian VII
to examine Biblical manuscripts in various countries. Adler
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pursued his Oriental studies at Rome and elsewhere; D. G.
Moldenhawer and O. G. Tychsen (the famous Orientalist of
Rostock) were sent into Spain in 1783-4; Birch travelled on the
same good errand in 1781-3 through Italy and Germany. The
combined results of their investigations were arranged and
published by Birch, whose folio edition of the Four Gospels (also
in 4to) with Stephen's text of 1550<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>, and the various readings
contributed by himself and his associates, full descriptive Prolegomena
and facsimiles of seven manuscripts (Codd. S, 157
Evan.; and five in Syriac), appeared at Copenhagen in 1788.
Seven years afterwards (1795) a fire destroyed the Royal
Printing-house, the type, paper, and unsold stock of the first
volume, the collations of the rest of the N. T. having very nearly
shared the same fate. These poor fragments were collected by
Birch into two small 8vo volumes, those relating to the Acts and
Epistles in 1798, to the Apocalypse (with facsimiles of Codd.
37, 42) in 1800. In 1801 he revised and re-edited the various
readings of the Gospels, in a form to correspond with those of the
rest of the N. T. Nothing can be better calculated to win
respect and confidence than the whole tone of Birch's several
Prolegomena: he displays at once a proper sense of the difficulties
of his task, and a consciousness that he had done his
utmost to conquer them<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>. It is indeed much to be regretted
that, for some cause he does not wish to explain, he accomplished
but little for Cod. B; many of the manuscripts on his long
list were beyond question examined but very superficially;
yet he was almost the first to open to us the literary treasures
of the Vatican, of Florence, and of Venice. He more or less
inspected the uncials Cod. B, Codd. ST of the Gospels, Cod.
L of the Acts and Epistles. His catalogue of cursives comprises
Codd. 127-225 of the Gospels; Codd. 63-7, 70-96 of
the Acts; Codd. 67-71, 77-112 of St. Paul; Codd. 33-4, 37-46
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Apocalypse; Evangelistaria 35-39; Apostolos 7, 8: in all
191 copies, a few of which were thoroughly collated (e.g. Evan.
S, 127, 131, 157, Evst. 36). Of Adler's labours we have spoken
already; they too are incorporated in Birch's work, and prefaced
with a short notice (Birch, Proleg. p. lxxxv) by their
author, a real and modest scholar. Moldenhawer's portion of the
common task was discharged in another spirit. Received at the
Escurial with courtesy and good-will, his colleague Tyschen and
he spent four whole months in turning over a collection of 760
Greek manuscripts, of which only twenty related to the Greek
Testament. They lacked neither leisure, nor opportunity, nor
competent knowledge; but they were full of dislike for Spain
and its religion, of overweening conceit, and of implicit trust in
Griesbach and his recensions. The whole paper contributed by
Moldenhawer to Birch's Prolegomena (pp. lxi-lxxxiv) is in substance
very disappointing, while its arrogance is almost
intolerable. What he effected for other portions of the N. T.
I have not been able to trace (226, 228 Evan., which also contain
the Acts and Epistles, are but nominally on Scholz's list for
those books); the fire at Copenhagen may probably have
destroyed his notes. Of the Gospels he collated eight codices
(226-233), and four Evangelistaria (40-43), most of them being
dismissed, after a cursory review, with some expression of hearty
contempt. To Evann. 226, 229, 230 alone was he disposed to pay
any attention; of the rest, whether <span class="tei tei-q">“he soon restored them to
their primitive obscurity”</span> (p. lxxi), or <span class="tei tei-q">“bade them sweet and
holy rest among the reliques of Saints and Martyrs”</span> (p. lxvii),
he may be understood to say, once for all, <span class="tei tei-q">“Omnino nemo, qui
horum librorum rationem ac indolem ... perspectam habet, ex
iis lectionis varietatem operose eruere aggredietur, nec, si quam
inde conquisiverit, operae pretium fecisse a peritis arbitris
existimabitur”</span> (p. lxxiv). It was not thus that Matthaei dealt
with the manuscripts at Moscow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. Such were the materials ready for Griesbach's use when
he projected his second and principal edition of the Greek Testament
(vol. i. 1796, vol. ii. 1806). Not that he was backward in
adding to the store of various readings by means of his own
diligence. His <span class="tei tei-q">“Symbolae Criticae<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a>”</span> (vol. i. 1785, vol. ii. 1793)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contained, together with the readings extracted from Origen,
collations, in whole or part, of many copies of various portions
of the N. T., Latin as well as Greek. Besides inspecting Codd.
AD (Evann.), and carefully examining Cod. C<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a>, he consulted
no less than twenty-six codices (including GL) of the Gospels,
ten (including E) of the Acts, &amp;c., fifteen (including DEH)
of St. Paul, one of the Apocalypse (Cod. 29) twelve Lectionaries
of the Gospels, and two of the Apostolos, far the greater
part of them being deposited in England. It was not, however,
his purpose to exhibit in his N. T. (designed, as it
was, for general use) all the readings he had himself recorded
elsewhere, much less the whole mass accumulated by the
pains of Mill or Wetstein, Matthaei or Birch. The distinctive
end at which he aims is to form such a selection from the
matter their works contain, as to enable the theological student
to decide for himself on the genuineness or corruption of any
given reading, by the aid of principles which he devotes his
best efforts to establish. Between the text (in which departures
from the Elzevir edition of 1624 are generally indicated by being
printed in smaller type<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a>) and the critical notes at the foot of
each page, intervenes a narrow space or inner margin, to receive
those portions of the common text which Griesbach has rejected,
and such variations of his authorities as he judges to be of equal
weight with the received readings which he retains, or but little
inferior to them. These decisions he intimates by several
symbols, not quite so simple as those employed by Bengel,
but conceived in a similar spirit; and he has carried his
system somewhat further in his small or manual edition, published
at Leipzig in 1805, which may be conceived to represent
his last thoughts with regard to the recension of the Greek text
of the N. T. But though we may trace some slight discrepancies
of opinion between his earliest<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> and his latest works<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a>, as might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
well be looked for in a literary career of forty years, yet the
theory of his youth was maintained, and defended, and temperately
applied by Griesbach even to the last. From Bengel and
Semler he had taken up the belief that manuscripts, versions,
and ecclesiastical writers divide themselves, with respect to
the character of their testimony, into races or families. This
principle he strove to reduce to practice by marshalling all his
authorities under their respective heads, and then regarding the
evidence, not of individuals, but of the classes to which they
belong. The advantage of some such arrangement is sufficiently
manifest, if only it could be made to rest on grounds in themselves
certain, or, at all events, fairly probable. We should then
possess some better guide in our choice between conflicting
readings, than the very rough and unsatisfactory process of
counting the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">number</span></em> of witnesses produced on either side. It is
not that such a mode of conducting critical enquiries would not
be very convenient, that Griesbach's theory is universally abandoned
by modern scholars, but because there is no valid reason
for believing it to be true.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the onset of his labours, indeed, this acute and candid
enquirer was disposed to divide all extant materials into five
or six different families; he afterwards limited them to three, the
Alexandrian, the Western, and the Byzantine recensions. The
standard of the Alexandrian text he conceived to be Origen;
who, although his works were written in Palestine, was assumed
to have brought with him into exile copies of Scripture, similar
to those used in his native city. To this family would belong
a few manuscripts of the earliest date, and confessedly of the
highest character, Codd. ABC, Cod. L of the Gospels, the
Egyptian and some lesser versions. The Western recension
would survive in Cod. D of the Gospels and Acts, in the other
ancient copies which contain a Latin translation, in the Old
Latin and Vulgate versions, and in the Latin Fathers. The vast
majority of manuscripts (comprising perhaps nineteen-twentieths
of the whole), together with the larger proportion of versions and
Patristic writings, were grouped into the Byzantine class, as
having prevailed generally in the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
To this last class Griesbach hardly professed to accord as much
weight as to either of the others, nor, if he had done so, would
the result have been materially different. The joint testimony
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of two classes was, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ceteris paribus</span></span>, always to prevail; and since
the very few documents which comprise the Alexandrian and
Western recensions seldom agree with the Byzantine even when
at variance with each other, the numerous codices which make
up the third family would thus have about as much share in
fixing the text of Scripture, as the poor citizens whose host
was included in one of Servius Tullius' lower classes possessed
towards counterbalancing the votes of the wealthy few that
composed his first or second<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Inasmuch as the manuscripts on which our received text was
based must, beyond question, be referred to his Byzantine family,
wide as were the variations of Griesbach's revised text from that
of Elzevir<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a>, had his theory been pushed to its legitimate consequences,
the changes it required would have been greater still.
The very plan of his work, however, seemed to reserve a slight
preference for the received text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as such</span></em>, in cases of doubt and
difficulty; and this editor, with a calmness and sagacity which
may well be called judicial, was usually disposed to relax his
stern mechanical law when persuaded by reasons founded on
internal probabilities, which (as we cheerfully admit) few men
have been found able to estimate with so much patience and
discrimination. The plain fact is, that while disciples like
Moldenhawer and persons who knew even less than he were
regarding Griesbach's system as self-evidently true, their wiser
master must have had many a misgiving as to the safety of that
imposing structure his rare ingenuity had built upon the sand.
The very essence of his theory consisted in there being not two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
distinct families, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>; the majority deciding in all cases
of dispute. Yet he hardly attempted, certainly neither he nor
any one after him succeeded in the attempt, to separate the
Alexandrian from the Western family, without resorting to
arguments which would prove that there are as many classes as
there are manuscripts of early date. The supposed accordance
of the readings of Origen, so elaborately scrutinized for this
purpose by Griesbach, with Cod. A, on which our editor lays
the greatest stress, has been shown by Archbishop Laurence
(Remarks on Griesbach's Systematic Classification, 1814) to
be in a high degree imaginary<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a>. It must have been in
anticipation of some such researches, and in a partial knowledge
of their sure results, that Griesbach was driven to that
violent and most unlikely hypothesis, that Cod. A follows the
Byzantine class of authorities in the Gospels, the Western in the
Acts and Catholic Epistles, and the Alexandrian in St. Paul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems needless to dwell longer on speculations which,
however attractive and once widely received, will scarcely again
find an advocate. Griesbach's text can no longer be regarded
as satisfactory, though it is far less objectionable than such
a system as his would have made it in rash or unskilful hands.
His industry, his moderation, his fairness to opponents, who (like
Matthaei) had shown him little forbearance, we may all imitate
to our profit. His logical acuteness and keen intellectual perception
fall to the lot of few; and though they may have helped
to lead him into error, and have even kept him from retracing
his steps, yet on the whole they were worthily exercised in the
good cause of promoting a knowledge of God's truth, and of
keeping alive, in an evil and unbelieving age, an enlightened
interest in Holy Scripture, and the studies which it serves to
consecrate.

13. Of a widely different order of mind was John Martin
Augustine Scholz [d. 1852], Roman Catholic Dean of Theology
in the mixed University of Bonn. It would have been well for
the progress of sacred learning and for his own reputation had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the accuracy and ability of this editor borne some proportion to
his zeal and obvious anxiety to be useful. His first essay was
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Curae Criticae in historiam textûs Evangeliorum,”</span> in two
dissertations, Heidelberg, 4to, 1820, containing notices of forty-eight
Paris manuscripts (nine of them hitherto unknown) of
which he had fully collated seventeen: the second Dissertation
is devoted to Cod. K of the Gospels. In 1823 appeared
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Biblisch-Kritische Reise,”</span> Leipsic, 8vo, Biblio-Critical
Travels in France, Switzerland, Italy, Palestine and the
Archipelago, which Schulz laid under contribution for his
improved edition of Griesbach's first volume<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a>. Scholz's <span class="tei tei-q">“N. T.
Graece,”</span> 4to, was published at Leipsic, vol. i, 1830 (Gospels);
vol. ii, 1836.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The accession of fresh materials made known in these works
is almost marvellous: Scholz was the first to indicate Codd. 260-469
of the Gospels; 110-192 of the Acts, &amp;c.; 125-246 of
St. Paul; 51-89 of the Apocalypse; 51-181 Evangelistaria;
21-58 Lectionaries of the Apostolos; in all 616 cursive codices.
His additions to the list of the uncials comprise only the
three fragments of the Gospels W<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span> Y and the Vatican leaves
of N. Of those examined previously by others he paid most
attention to Evan. KX (M also for its synaxaria), and G
(now L) Act., Paul.; he moreover inspected slightly eighty-two
cursive codices of the Gospels after Wetstein, Birch, and the rest;
collated entire five (Codd. 4, 19, 25, 28, 33), and twelve in the
greater part, adding much to our knowledge of the important
Cod. 22. In the Acts, &amp;c., he inspected twenty-seven of those
known before, partially collated two; in St. Paul he collated
partially two, slightly twenty-nine; in the Apocalypse sixteen,
cursorily enough it would seem (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Codd. 21-3): of the
Lectionaries he touched more or less thirteen of the Gospels, four
of the Apostolos. On turning to the 616 codices Scholz placed
on the list for the first time, we find that he collated entire but
thirteen (viz. five of the Gospels, three of the Acts, &amp;c., three of
St. Paul, one each of the Apocalypse and Evangelistaria): a few
of the rest he examined throughout the greater part; many in
only a few chapters; while some were set down from printed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Catalogues, whose plenteous errors we have used our best
endeavours to correct in the present volume, so far as the means
were within our reach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, after making a large deduction from our first impressions
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amount</span></em> of labour performed by Scholz, enough and more
than enough would remain to entitle him to our lasting gratitude,
if it were possible to place any tolerable reliance on the
correctness of his results. Those who are, however superficially,
acquainted with the nature of such pursuits, will readily believe
that faultless accuracy in representing myriads of minute details
is not to be looked for from the most diligent and careful critic.
Oversights will mar the perfection of the most highly finished
of human efforts; but if adequate care and pains shall have
been bestowed on detecting them, such blemishes as still linger
unremoved are no real subject of reproach, and do not greatly
lessen the value of the work which contains them. But in the
case of Scholz's Greek Testament the fair indulgence we must all
hope for is abused beyond the bounds of reason or moderation.
The student who has had much experience of his volumes,
especially if he has ever compared the collations there given
with the original manuscripts, will never dream of resorting to
them for information he can expect to gain elsewhere, or rest
with confidence on a statement of fact merely because Scholz
asserts it. J. Scott Porter (Principles of Textual Criticism,
Belfast, 1848, pp. 263-66) and Tischendorf (N. T., Proleg. c-cii,
7th edition) have dwelt upon his strange blunders, his blind
inconsistencies, and his habitual practice of copying from his
predecessors without investigation and without acknowledgement;
so that it is needless for us to repeat or dwell on that
ungracious task<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a>; but it is our duty to put the student once for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all on his guard against what could not fail to mislead him, and
to express our sorrow that twelve years and more of hard and
persevering toil should, through mere heedlessness, have been
nearly thrown away.

As was natural in a pupil of J. L. Hug of Freyburg (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> vol. i.
p. 111), who had himself tried to build a theory of recensions on
very slender grounds, Dr. Scholz attempted to settle the text of
the N. T. upon principles which must be regarded as a modification
of those of Griesbach. In his earliest work, like that great
critic, he had been disposed to divide all extant authorities
into five separate classes; but he soon reduced them to two, the
Alexandrian and the Constantinopolitan. In the Alexandrian
family he included the whole of Griesbach's Western recension,
from which indeed it seems vain to distinguish it by any broad
line of demarcation: to the other family he referred the great
mass of more recent documents which compose Griesbach's third
or Byzantine class; and to this family he was inclined to give
the preference over the other, as well from the internal excellency
of its readings, as because it represents the uniform text which
had become traditional throughout the Greek Church. That
such a standard, public, and authorized text existed he seems to
have taken for granted without much enquiry. <span class="tei tei-q">“Codices qui
hoc nomen [Constantinopolitanum] habent,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“parum
inter se dissentiunt. Conferas, quaeso, longè plerosque quos huic
classi adhaerere dixi, atque lectiones diversas viginti trigintave
in totidem capitibus vix reperies, unde conjicias eos esse accuratissimè
descriptos, eorumque antigrapha parum inter se discrepasse”</span>
(N. T., Proleg., vol. i. § 55). It might have occurred to
one who had spent so many years in studying Greek manuscripts,
that this marvellous concord between the different
Byzantine witnesses (which is striking enough, no doubt, as we
turn over the pages of his Greek Testament) is after all due to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nothing so much as to the haste and carelessness of collators.
The more closely the cursive copies of Scripture are examined,
the more does the individual character of each of them become
developed. With certain points of general resemblance, whereby
they are distinguished from the older documents of the Alexandrian
class, they abound with mutual variations so numerous
and perpetual as to vouch for the independent origin of nearly
all of them, and their exact study has <span class="tei tei-q">“swept away at once and
for ever”</span> (Tregelles' <span class="tei tei-q">“Account of Printed Text,”</span> p. 180) the fancy
of a standard Constantinopolitan text, and every inference that
had been grounded upon its presumed existence. If (as we
firmly believe) the less ancient codices ought to have their
proper weight and appreciable influence in fixing the true text
of Scripture, our favourable estimate of them must rest on other
arguments than Scholz has urged in their behalf.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since this editor's system of recensions differed thus widely
from Griesbach's, in suppressing altogether one of his three
classes, and in yielding to the third, which the other slighted,
a decided preference over its surviving rival, it might have been
imagined that the consequences of such discrepancy in theory
would have been strongly marked in their effects on his text.
That such is not the case, at least to any considerable extent
(especially in his second volume), must be imputed in part to
Griesbach's prudent reserve in carrying out his principles to
extremity, but yet more to Scholz's vacillation and evident
weakness of judgement. In fact, on his last visit to England in
1845, he distributed among Biblical students here a <span class="tei tei-q">“Commentatio
de virtutibus et vitiis utriusque codicum N. T. familiae,”</span>
that he had just delivered on the occasion of some Encaenia at
Bonn, in which (after various statements that display either
ignorance or inattention respecting the ordinary phenomena of
manuscripts which in a veteran collator is really unaccountable<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>)
he declares his purpose, chiefly it would seem from considerations
of internal evidence, that if ever it should be his lot to prepare
another edition of the New Testament, <span class="tei tei-q">“se plerasque codicum
Alexandrinorum lectiones illas quas in margine interiore textui
editionis suae Alexandrinas dixit, in textum recepturum”</span> (p. 14).
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The text which its constructor distrusted, can have but small
claim on the faith of others.

14. <span class="tei tei-q">“Novum Testamentum Graece et Latine, Carolus Lachmannus
recensuit, Philippus Buttmannus Ph. F. Graecae lectionis
auctoritates apposuit”</span> is the simple title-page of a work, by one
of the most eminent philologists of his time, the first volume of
which (containing the Gospels) appeared at Berlin (8vo), 1842, the
second and concluding one in 1850, whose boldness and originality
have procured it, as well for good as for ill, a prominent
place in the history of the sacred text. Lachmann had published
as early as 1831 a small edition containing only the text of the
New Testament, with a list of the readings wherein he differs
from that of Elzevir, preceded by a notice of his plan not
exceeding a few lines in length, itself so obscurely worded that
even to those who happened to understand his meaning it must
have read like a riddle whose solution they had been told
beforehand; and referring us for fuller information to what
he strangely considered <span class="tei tei-q">“a more convenient place,”</span> a German
periodical of the preceding year's date<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a>. Authors who take
so little pains to explain their fundamental principles of
criticism, especially if (as in the present case) these are novel
and unexpected, can hardly wonder when their drift and purpose
are imperfectly apprehended; so that a little volume, which we
now learn had cost Lachmann five years of thought and labour,
was confounded, even by the learned, with the mass of common,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hasty, and superficial reprints. Nor was the difficulty much
removed on the publication of the first volume of his larger
book. It was then seen, indeed, how clean a sweep he had
made of the great majority of Greek manuscripts usually cited
in critical editions:—in fact he rejects all in a heap excepting
Codd. ABC, the fragments PQTZ (and for some purposes D) of
the Gospels; DE of the Acts only; DGH of St. Paul. Yet even
now he treats the scheme of his work as if it were already
familiarly known, and spends his time in discursive controversy
with his opponents and reviewers, whom he chastises with
a heartiness which in this country we imputed to downright
malice, till Tregelles was so good as to instruct us that in Lachmann
it was but <span class="tei tei-q">“a tone of pleasantry,”</span> the horseplay of coarse
German wit (Account of Printed Text, p. 112). The supplementary
Prolegomena which preface his second volume of 1850 are
certainly more explicit: both from what they teach and from
the practical examples they contain, they have probably helped
others, as well as myself, in gaining a nearer insight into his
whole design.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems, then, to have been Lachmann's purpose, discarding
the slightest regard for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">textus receptus</span></span> as such, to endeavour
to bring the sacred text back to the condition in which it existed
during the fourth century, and this in the first instance by
documentary aid alone, without regarding for the moment
whether the sense produced were probable or improbable, good
or bad; but looking solely to his authorities, and following
them implicitly wheresoever the numerical majority might
carry him. For accomplishing this purpose he possessed but
one Greek copy written as early as the fourth century, Cod. B;
and of that he not only knew less than has since come to light
(and even this is not quite sufficient), but he did not avail
himself of Bartolocci's papers on Cod. B, to which Scholz had
already drawn attention. His other codices were not of the
fourth century at all, but varying in date from the fifth (ACT)
to the ninth (G); and of these few (of C more especially) his
assistant or colleague Buttmann's representation was loose, careless,
and unsatisfactory. Of the Greek Fathers, the scanty
Greek remains of Irenaeus and the works of Origen are all that
are employed; but considerable weight is given to the readings
of the Latin version. The Vulgate is printed at length as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
revised, after a fashion, by Lachmann himself, from the Codices
Fuldensis and Amiatinus: the Old Latin manuscripts <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abc</span></span>,
together with the Latin versions accompanying the Greek copies
which he receives<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>, are treated as primary authorities: of the
Western Fathers he quotes Cyprian, Hilary of Poictiers, Lucifer
of Cagliari, and in the Apocalypse Primasius also. The Syriac
and Egyptian translations he considers himself excused from
attending to, by reason of his ignorance of their respective
languages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The consequence of this voluntary poverty where our manuscript
treasures are so abundant, of this deliberate rejection of
the testimony of many hundreds of documents, of various
countries, dates, and characters, may be told in a few words.
Lachmann's text seldom rests on more than four Greek codices,
very often on three, not unfrequently on two; in Matt. vi. 20-viii.
5, and in 165 out of the 405 verses of the Apocalypse, on
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>. It would have been a grievous thing indeed if we
really had no better means of ascertaining the true readings of
the New Testament than are contained in this editor's scanty
roll; and he who, for the sake of some private theory, shall
presume to shut out from his mind the great mass of information
God's Providence has preserved for our use, will hardly be
thought to have chosen the most hopeful method for bringing
himself or others to the knowledge of the truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But supposing, for the sake of argument, that Lachmann had
availed himself to the utmost of the materials he has selected,
and that they were adequate for the purpose of leading him up
to the state of the text as it existed in the fourth century, would
he have made any real advance in the criticism of the sacred
volume? Is it not quite evident, even from the authorities contained
in his notes, that copies in that age varied as widely—nay
even more widely—than they did in later times? that the
main corruptions and interpolations which perplex the student
in Cod. Bezae and its Latin allies, crept in at a period anterior
to the age of Constantine? From the Preface to his second
volume (1850) it plainly appears (what might, perhaps, have
been gathered by an esoteric pupil from the Preface to his first,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pp. v, xxxiii), that he regarded this fourth century text, founded
as it is on documentary evidence alone, as purely provisional;
as mere subject-matter on which individual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conjecture</span></em> might
advantageously operate (Praef. 1850, p. v). Of the many
examples wherewith he illustrates his principle we must be
content with producing one, as an ample specimen both of
Lachmann's plan and of his judgement in reducing it to practice.
In Matt. xxvii. 28 for ἐκδύσαντες, which gives a perfectly good
sense, and seems absolutely required by τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ in ver. 31,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">BDabc</span></span> read ἐνδύσαντες, a variation either borrowed from Mark
xv. 17, or more probably a mere error of the pen. Had the
whole range of manuscripts, versions, and Fathers been searched,
no other testimony in favour of ἐνδύσαντες could have been
found save Cod. 157, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">q</span></span> of the Old Latin, the Latin
version of Origen, and a few codices of Chrysostom<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a>. Against
these we might set a vast company of witnesses, exceeding those
on the opposite side by full a hundred to one; yet because Cod.
A and the Latin Vulgate alone are on Lachmann's list, he is
compelled by his system to place ἐνδύσαντες in the text as the
reading of his authorities, reserving to himself the privilege of
removing it on the ground of its palpable impropriety: and all
this because he wishes to keep the <span class="tei tei-q">“recensio”</span> of the text distinct
from the <span class="tei tei-q">“emendatio”</span> of the sense (Praef. 1850, p. vi). Surely
it were a far more reasonable, as well as a more convenient
process, to have reviewed from the first the entire case on both
sides, and if the documentary evidence were not unevenly
balanced, or internal evidence strongly preponderated in one
scale, to place in the text once for all the reading which upon
the whole should appear best suited to the passage, and most
sufficiently established by authority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But while we cannot accord to Lachmann the praise of wisdom
in his design, or of over-much industry and care in the execution
of it (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Tischendorf, N. T., Proleg. pp. cvii-cxii), yet we
would not dissemble or extenuate the power his edition has
exerted over candid and enquiring minds. Earnest, single-hearted,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a true scholar both in spirit and accomplishments, he
has had the merit of restoring the Latin versions to their proper
rank in the criticism of the New Testament, which since the
failure of Bentley's schemes they seem to have partially lost.
No one will hereafter claim for the received text any further
weight than it is entitled to as the representative of the manuscripts
on which it was constructed: and the principle of
recurring exclusively to a few ancient documents in preference
to the many (so engaging from its very simplicity), which may
be said to have virtually originated with him, has not been
without influence with some who condemn the most strongly his
hasty and one-sided, though consistent, application of it. Lachmann
died in 1851.

question the most full and comprehensive edition of the Greek
Testament existing; it contains the results of the latest collations
and discoveries, and as copious a body of various readings
as is compatible with the design of adapting it for general use:
though Tischendorf's notes are not sufficiently minute (as regards
the cursive manuscripts) to supersede the need of perpetually
consulting the labours of preceding critics. His earliest enterprise<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a>
in connexion with Biblical studies was a small edition of
the New Testament (12mo, 1841), completed at Leipzig in 1840,
which, although greatly inferior to his subsequent works, merited
the encouragement which it procured for him, and the praises of
D. Schulz, which he very gratefully acknowledged. Soon afterwards
he set out on his first literary journey: <span class="tei tei-q">“quod quidem tam
pauper suscepi,”</span> he ingenuously declares, <span class="tei tei-q">“ut pro paenula quam
portabam solvere non possem;”</span> and, while busily engaged on
Cod. C, prepared three other editions of the New Testament,
which appeared in 1843 at Paris, all of them being booksellers'
speculations on which, perhaps, he set no high value; one
inscribed to Guizot, the Protestant statesman, a second (having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Greek text placed in a parallel column with the Latin
Vulgate, and somewhat altered to suit it) dedicated to Denys
Affre, the Archbishop of Paris who fell so nobly at the barricades
in June, 1848. His third edition of that year contained the
Greek text of the second edition, without the Latin Vulgate. It
is needless to enlarge upon the history of his travels, sufficiently
described by Tischendorf in the Preface to his seventh edition
(1859); it will be enough to state that he was in Italy in 1843
and 1866; four times he visited England (1842, 1849, 1855,
1865); and thrice went into the East, where his chief discovery—that
of the Cod. Sinaiticus—was ultimately made. In 1849
came forth his second Leipzig or fifth edition of the New Testament,
showing a very considerable advance upon that of 1841, though,
in its earlier pages more especially, still very defective, and even
as a manual scarce worthy of his rapidly growing fame. The
sixth edition was one stereotyped for Tauchnitz in 1850 (he put
forth another stereotyped edition in 1862), representing the text
of 1849 slightly revised: the seventh, and up to that date by
far the most important, was issued in thirteen parts at Leipsic
during the four years 1856-9. It is indeed a monument of
persevering industry which the world has not often seen surpassed:
yet it was soon to be thrown into the shade by his
eighth and latest edition, issued in eleven parts, between 1864
and 1872, the text of which is complete, but the Prolegomena, to
our great loss, were never written, by reason of his illness and
death (Dec. 7, 1874)<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet it may truly be asserted that the reputation of Tischendorf
as a Biblical scholar rests less on his critical editions of the N. T.,
than on the texts of the chief uncial authorities which in rapid
succession he has given to the world. In 1843 was published
the New Testament, in 1845 the Old Testament portion of <span class="tei tei-q">“Codex
Ephraemi Syri rescriptus (Cod. C)”</span>, 2 vols. 4to, in uncial type,
with elaborate Prolegomena, notes, and facsimiles. In 1846

the plan and apparatus of this volume and of nearly all that
follow are the same as in the Codex Ephraemi. In 1846 he also
published the Codex Friderico-Augustanus in lithographed facsimile
throughout, containing the results of his first discovery at
Mount Sinai: in 1847 the Evangelium Palatinum ineditum of
the Old Latin: in 1850 and again in 1854 less splendid but
good and useful editions of the Codex Amiatinus of the Latin
Vulgate. His edition of Codex Claromontanus (D of St. Paul),
1852, was of precisely the same nature as his editions of Cod.
Ephraemi, &amp;c, but his book entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Anecdota sacra et profana,”</span>
1855 (second and enlarged edition in 1861), exhibits a more
miscellaneous character, comprising (together with other matter)
transcripts of O<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span> of the Gospels, M of St. Paul; a collation of
Cod. 61 of the Acts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being the only cursive copy he seems to have

<span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita”</span> (projected to consist of nine volumes),
on the same plan as the book of 1846. Much of this series is
devoted to codices of the Septuagint version, to which
Tischendorf paid great attention, and whereof he published four
editions (the latest in 1869) hardly worthy of him; but vol. i
(1855) contains transcripts of Codd. I, ven<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ev</span></span>. (Evst. 175); vol. ii
(1857) of Codd. N<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span>RΘ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span>; vol. iii (1860) of Codd. QW<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>, all of the
Gospels; vol. iv (1869) was given up to the Septuagint, as vol. vii
would have been to the Wolfenbüttel manuscript of Chrysostom,
of the sixth century; but Cod. P of the Acts, Epistles, and
Apocalypse comprises a portion of vols. v (1865) and of vi (1869);
while vol. viii was to have been devoted to palimpsest fragments
of both Testaments, such as we have described amongst the
Uncials: the Appendix or vol. ix (1870) contains Cod. E of the
Acts, &amp;c. An improved edition of his system of Gospel Harmony
(Synopsis Evangelica, 1851) appeared in 1864, with some fresh
critical matter, a better one in 1871, and the fifth in 1884. His
achievements in regard to Codd. א and Β we have spoken of in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their proper places. He published his <span class="tei tei-q">“Notitia Cod. Sinaitici”</span> in
1860, his great edition of that manuscript in 1862, with full
notes and Prolegomena; smaller editions of the New Testament
only in 1863 and 1865; <span class="tei tei-q">“an Appendix Codd. celeberrimorum
Sinaitici, Vaticani, Alexandrini with facsimiles”</span> in 1867. His
marvellous yet unsatisfactory edition of Cod. Vaticanus, prepared
under the disadvantages we have described, appeared in 1867;
its <span class="tei tei-q">“Appendix”</span> (including Cod. B of the Apocalypse) in 1869; his
unhappy <span class="tei tei-q">“Responsa ad calumnias Romanas”</span> in 1870. To this long
and varied catalogue must yet be added exact collations of Codd.
EGHKMUX Gospels, EGHL Acts, FHL of St. Paul, and more,
all made for his editions of the N. T. A poor issue of the
Authorized English Version of the N. T. was put forth in his name
in 1869, being the thousandth volume of Tauchnitz's series.

The consideration of the text of Tischendorf's several editions

of his collations every one who has followed him over a portion
of his vast field can bear and is bound to bear cheerful testimony.
For practical purposes his correctness is quite sufficient,
even though one or two who have accomplished very much less
may have excelled in this respect some at least of his later
works. For the unflinching exertions and persevering toil of
full thirty years Tischendorf was called upon in 1873 to pay
the natural penalty in a stroke of paralysis, which prostrated
his strong frame, and put a sudden end to his most fruitful
studies. He was born at Lengenfeld in the kingdom of Saxony
in 1815 and died in 1874, having nearly completed his sixtieth

with a new English Version,”</span> 1844: and, in spite of some obvious
blemishes and defects, his attempt was received in the English
Church with the gratitude and respect to which his thorough
earnestness and independent views justly entitled him. He had
arranged in his own mind as early as 1838 the plan of a Greek
Testament, which he announced on the publication of the
Apocalypse, and now set himself vigorously to accomplish. His
fruitless endeavour to collate Cod. B has already been mentioned,
but when he was on the continent in 1845-6, and again in
1849-50, also in 1862, he thoroughly examined all the manuscripts
he could meet with, that fell within the compass of his design.

early in 1861 the second part, containing SS. Luke and John
(pp. 217-488), with but a few pages of <span class="tei tei-q">“Introductory Notice”</span> in
each. In that year, paralysis, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mercurialium pestis virorum</span></span>,
for a while suspended our editor's too assiduous labours: but
he recovered health sufficient to publish the Acts and Catholic
Epistles in 1865, the Epistles of St. Paul down to 2 Thess. in
1869. Early in 1870, while in the act of revising the concluding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chapters of the Apocalypse, he was visited by a second and very
severe stroke of his fell disease. The remaining portion of the
Pauline Epistles was sent out in 1870 as he had himself prepared
it; the Revelation (alas! without the long-desired Prolegomena)
in 1872, as well as the state of Tregelles' papers would enable
his friends S. J. B. Bloxsidge and B. W. Newton to perform
their office. The revered author could contribute nothing save a
message to his subscribers, full of devout thankfulness and calm
reliance on the Divine wisdom. The text of the Apocalypse
differs from that which he arranged in 1844 in about 229 places.

Except Codd. ΟΞ, which were published in 1861 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> under
those MSS.), this critic has not edited in full the text of any
document, but his renewed collations of manuscripts are very
extensive: viz. Codd. EGHKMN<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span>RUXZΓΛ 1, 33, 69 of the
Gospels; HL 13, 31, 61 of the Acts; DFL 1, 17, 37 of St. Paul,
1, 14 of the Apocalypse, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Am.</span></span> of the Vulgate. Having followed
Tregelles through the whole of Cod. 69 (Act. 31, Paul. 37,
Apoc. 14), I am able to speak positively of his scrupulous exactness,
and in regard to other manuscripts now in England it
will be found that, where Tischendorf and Tregelles differ, the
latter is seldom in the wrong. To the versions and Fathers
(especially to Origen and Eusebius) he has devoted great
attention. His volume is a beautiful specimen of typography<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>,
and its arrangement is very convenient, particularly his happy
expedient for showing at every open leaf the precise authorities
that are extant at that place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The peculiarity of Tregelles' system is intimated, rather than
stated, in the title-page of his Greek N. T. It consists in
resorting to <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient authorities”</span> alone in the construction of
his revised text, and in refusing not only to the received text,
but to the great mass of manuscripts also, all voice in determining
the true readings. This scheme, although from the
history he gives of his work (An Account of Printed Text,
pp. 153, &amp;c.), it was apparently devised independently of
Lachmann, is in fact essentially that great scholar's plan, after
those parts of it are withdrawn which are manifestly indefensible.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Tregelles' <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient authorities”</span> are thus reduced to those
manuscripts which, not being Lectionaries, happen to be written
in uncial characters, with the remarkable exceptions of Codd.
1, 33, 69 of the Gospels, 61 of the Acts, which he admits because
they <span class="tei tei-q">“preserve an ancient text.”</span> We shall hereafter enquire
(Chap. <a href="#Chapter_X" class="tei tei-ref">X</a>) whether the text of the N. T. can safely be grounded
on a basis so narrow as that of Tregelles.

This truly eminent person, born at Falmouth of a Quaker
family January 30, 1813, received what education he ever got
at Falmouth Classical School (of which I was Master twenty
years later), from 1825 to 1828. At an early age he left the
communion in which he was bred, to join a body called the
Plymouth Brethren, among whom he met with much disquietude
and some mild persecution: his last years were more happily
spent as a humble lay member of the Church of England, a fact
he very earnestly begged me to keep in mind<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>. The critical
studies he took up as early as 1838, when he was only twenty-five
years old, were the main occupation of his life. The
inconvenient and costly form in which he published his Greek
Testament, brought upon him pecuniary loss, and even trenched
upon the moderate fortune of his true and loving wife. After
several years of deep retirement he died at Plymouth, April 24,
1875: and whereas his widow, who has since followed him to the
other world, was anxious that his great work should be as far as
possible completed, Dr. Hort has manifested his veneration for
an honoured memory by publishing in 1879 an <span class="tei tei-q">“Appendix”</span> to the
Greek New Testament, embracing what materials for Prolegomena
Tregelles' published writings supplied, and supplementary
corrections to every page of the main work, compiled by the Rev.
A. W. Streane, Fellow of C. C. C, Cambridge, which comprise
a wonderful monument of minute diligence and devotion.

important and comprehensive work, the joint labour of two of the
best scholars of this age, toiling, now separately, now in counsel,
for five and twenty years, was published, the text a few days
earlier than the Revised English Version (May 17, 1881), the
Introduction about four months later. The text, or one almost
identical with it, had been submitted to the Revisers of the N. T.,
and to a few other Biblical students, several years before, so that
the general tenor and spirit of our authors' judgement was known
to many: the second edition of my present work was enriched
by the free permission granted by them to announce their conclusions
regarding passages which come up for discussion in
Chapter <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>, and elsewhere. Drs. Westcott and Hort depart more
widely from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">textus receptus</span></span> than any previous editor had
thought necessary; nor can they be blamed for carrying out
their deliberate convictions, if the reasons they allege shall prove
sufficient to justify them. Those reasons are given at length by
Dr. Hort in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction,”</span> a treatise whose merits may be
frankly acknowledged by persons the least disposed to accept
his arguments: never was a cause, good or bad in itself, set off
with higher ability and persuasive power. On the validity of
his theory we shall have much to say in Chapters <a href="#Chapter_X" class="tei tei-ref">X</a> and <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>,
to which we here refer once for all. The elegant volume which
exhibits the Greek text contains in its margin many alternative
readings, chiefly recorded in passages wherein a difference of
opinion existed between the two illustrious editors. Words or
passages supposed to be of doubtful authority are included in
brackets ([ ]), those judged to be probably or certainly spurious—and
their number is ominously large—in double brackets
([[ ]]). Mark xvi. 9-20; John vii. 53-viii. 11 are banished to the
end of their respective Gospels, as if they did not belong to
them. Finally, quotations from and even slight allusions to the
Old Testament, in great but judicious plenty, are printed in
a kind of uncial letter, to the great benefit of the student.

18. The text constructed by the English Revisers in preparation
for their Revised Translation was published in two
forms at Oxford and Cambridge respectively in 1881. The
Oxford edition, under the care of Archdeacon Palmer, incorporated
in the text the readings adopted by the Revisers with
the variations at the foot of the Authorized edition of 1611,
of Stephanus' third edition published in 1550, and of the margin
of the Revised Version. The Cambridge edition, under the care
of Dr. Scrivener, gave the Authorized text with the variations of
the Revisers mentioned at the foot. Both editions are admirably
edited. The number of variations adopted by the Revisers,
which are generally based upon the principles advocated by
Westcott and Hort, has been estimated by Dr. Scrivener at
5,337 (Burgon's <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision Revised,”</span> p. 405). The titles in full of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have now described, in some detail, the several species
of external testimony available for the textual criticism
of the New Testament, whether comprising manuscripts of the
original Greek, or ancient translations from it, or citations from
Scripture made by ecclesiastical writers. We have, moreover,
indicated the chief editions wherein all these materials are
recorded for our use, and the principles that have guided their
several editors in applying them to the revision of the text.
One source of information, formerly deemed quite legitimate, has
been designedly passed by. It is now agreed among competent
judges that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conjectural Emendation</span></span> must never be resorted to,
even in passages of acknowledged difficulty<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a>; the absence of
proof that a reading proposed to be substituted for the common
one is actually supported by some trustworthy document being
of itself a fatal objection to our receiving it<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a>. Those that have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been hazarded aforetime by celebrated scholars, when but few
codices were known or actually collated, have seldom, very
seldom, been confirmed by subsequent researches: and the time
has now fully come when, in the possession of abundant stores
of variations collected from memorials of almost every age and
country, we are fully authorized in believing that the reading
to which no manuscript, or old version, or primitive Father
has borne witness, however plausible and (for some purposes)
convenient, cannot safely be accepted as genuine or even as
probable; even though there may still remain a few passages
respecting which we cannot help framing a shrewd suspicion
that the original reading differed from any form in which they
are now presented to us<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In no wise less dangerous than bare conjecture destitute of
external evidence, is the device of Lachmann for unsettling by
means of emendation (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">emendando</span></span>), without reference to the
balance of conflicting testimony, the very text he had previously
fixed by revision (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">recensendo</span></span>) through the means of critical
authorities: in fact the earlier process is but so much trouble
misemployed, if its results are liable to be put aside by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abstract judgement or individual prejudices. Not that the most
sober and cautious critic would disparage the fair use of internal
evidence, or withhold their proper influence from those reasonable
considerations which in practice cannot, and in speculation
should not, be shut out from every subject on which the mind
seeks to form an intelligent opinion. Whether we will or not,
we unconsciously and almost instinctively adopt that one of two
opposite statements, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in themselves pretty equally attested to</span></em>,
which we judge the better suited to recognized phenomena,
and to the common course of things. I know of no person
who has affected to construct a text of the N. T. on diplomatic
grounds exclusively, without paying some regard to the character
of the sense produced; nor, were the experiment tried, would
any one find it easy to dispense with discretion and the
dictates of good sense: nature would prove too strong for the
dogmas of a wayward theory. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is difficult not to indulge in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjectiveness</span></em>, at least in some measure,”</span> writes Dr. Tregelles
(Account of Printed Text, p. 109): and, thus qualified, we may
add that it is one of those difficulties a sane man would not wish
to overcome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The foregoing remarks may tend to explain the broad distinction
between mere conjectural emendation, which must be
utterly discarded, and that just use of internal testimony which
he is the best critic who most judiciously employs. They so
far resemble each other, as they are both products of the
reasoning faculty exercising itself on the sacred words of Scripture:
they differ in this essential feature, that the one proceeds
in ignorance or disregard of evidence from without, while the
office of the other has no place unless where external evidence
is evenly, or at any rate not very unevenly, balanced. What
degree of preponderance in favour of one out of several readings,
all of them affording some tolerable sense, shall entitle it
to reception as a matter of right; to what extent canons of subjective
criticism may be allowed to eke out the scantiness of
documentary authority; are points that cannot well be defined
with strict accuracy. Men's decisions respecting them will
always vary according to their temperament and intellectual
habits; the judgement of the same person (the rather if he be
by constitution a little unstable) will fluctuate from time to
time as to the same evidence brought to bear on the self-same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
passage. Though the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canons</span></em> or rules of internal testimony be
themselves grounded either on principles of common sense, or
on certain peculiarities which all may mark in the documents
from which our direct proofs are derived; yet has it been found
by experience (what indeed we might have looked for beforehand),
that in spite, perhaps in consequence, of their extreme
simplicity, the application of these canons has proved
a searching test of the tact, the sagacity, and the judicial
acumen of all that handle them. For the other functions of an
editor accuracy and learning, diligence and zeal are sufficient:
but the delicate adjustment of conflicting probabilities calls for
no mean exercise of a critical genius. This innate faculty we
lack in Wetstein, and notably in Scholz; it was highly
developed in Mill and Bengel, and still more in Griesbach. His
well-known power in this respect is the main cause of our deep
regret for the failure of Bentley's projected work, with all its
faults whether of plan or execution.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nearly all the following rules of internal evidence, being
founded in the nature of things, are alike applicable to all subjects
of literary investigation, though their general principles
may need some modification in the particular instance of the
Greek Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Proclivi Scriptioni praestat ardua</span></span>: the more difficult
the reading the more likely it is to be genuine. It would seem
more probable that the copyist tried to explain an obscure
passage, or to relieve a hard construction, than to make that
perplexed which before was easy: thus in John vii. 39,
Lachmann's addition of δεδομένον to οὔπω ἦν πνεῦμα ἅγιον is very
improbable, though countenanced by Cod. B and (of course) by
several of the chief versions. We have here Bengel's prime
canon, and although Wetstein questioned it (N. T., vol. i. Proleg.
p. 157), he was himself ultimately obliged to lay down something
nearly to the same effect<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a>. Yet this excellent rule may easily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be applied on a wrong occasion, and is only true <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ceteris paribus</span></span>,
where manuscripts or versions lend strong support to the harder
form. <span class="tei tei-q">“To force readings into the text merely because they are
difficult, is to adulterate the divine text with human alloy; it is
to obtrude upon the reader of Scripture the solecisms of faltering
copyists, in the place of the word of God”</span> (Bp. Chr. Wordsworth,
N. T., vol. i. Preface, p. xii)<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a>. See Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a> on Matt. xxi. 28-31.
Compare also above, Vol. I. i. § 11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. That reading out of several is preferable, from which
all the rest may have been derived, although it could not be
derived from any of them. Tischendorf (N. T., Proleg. p. xlii.
7th edition) might well say that this would be <span class="tei tei-q">“omnium
regularum principium,”</span> if its application were less precarious.
Of his own two examples the former is too weakly vouched for
to be listened to, save by way of illustration. In Matt. xxiv. 38
he<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> and Alford would simply read ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ κατακλυσμοῦ
on the very feeble evidence of Cod. L, one uncial Evst.
(13), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span>, the Sahidic version, and Origen (in two places);
because the copyists, knowing that the eating and drinking and
marrying took place not in the days of the flood, but before
them (καὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἕως ἦλθεν ὁ κατακλυσμός ver. 39), would
strive to evade the difficulty, such as it was, by adopting one of
the several forms found in our copies: ἡμέραις πρὸ τοῦ κατακλ.,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or ἡμέραις ταῖς πρὸ τοῦ κατακλ., or ἡμέραις ἐκείναις πρὸ τοῦ
κατακλ., or ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ταῖς πρὸ τοῦ κατακλ., or even ἡμέραις
τοῦ νῶε. In his second example Tischendorf is more fortunate,
unless indeed we choose to refer it rather to Bengel's canon.
James iii. 12 certainly ought to run μὴ δύναται, ἀδελφοί μου, συκῆ
ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι, ἢ ἄμπελος σῦκα; οὔτε (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vel</span></span> οὐδὲ) ἁλυκὸν γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι
ὕδωρ, as in Codd. אABC, in not less than six good cursives, the
Vulgate and other versions. To soften the ruggedness of this
construction, some copies prefixed οὅτως to οὔτε or οὔδε, while
others inserted the whole clause οὕτως οὐδεμία πηγὴ ἁλυκὸν καί
before γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ. Other fair instances may be seen in
Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>, notes on Luke x. 41, 42; Col. ii. 2<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>. In the Septuagint
also the reading of א συνεισελθόντας 1 Macc. xii. 48 appears to be
the origin both of συνελθόντας with A, the uncial 23, and four
cursives at least, and of εἰσελθόντας of the Roman edition and the
mass of cursives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. <span class="tei tei-q">“Brevior lectio, nisi testium vetustorum et gravium
auctoritate penitus destituatur, praeferenda est verbosiori. Librarii
enim multò proniores ad addendum fuerunt, quam ad
omittendum”</span> (Griesbach, N. T., Proleg. p. lxiv. vol. i). This
canon bears an influential part in the system of Griesbach and
his successors, and by the aid of Cod. B and a few others, has
brought great changes into the text as approved by some critics.
Dr. Green too (Course of Developed Criticism on Text of N. T.)
sometimes carries it to excess in his desire to remove what he
considers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accretions</span></em>. It is so far true, that scribes were no
doubt prone to receive marginal notes into the text which they
were originally designed only to explain or enforce (e.g.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1 John v. 7, 8)<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a>; or sought to amplify a brief account from
a fuller narrative of the same event found elsewhere, whether in
the same book (e.g. Act. ix. 5 compared with ch. xxvi. 14), or
in the parallel passage of one of the other synoptical Gospels.
In quotations, also, from the Old Testament the shorter form is
always the more probably correct (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>). Circumstances too
will be supplied which were deemed essential for the preservation
of historical truth (e.g. Act. viii. 37), or names of persons and
places may be inserted from the Lectionaries: and to this head
we must refer the graver and more deliberate interpolations so
frequently met with in Cod. D and a few other documents. Yet
it is just as true that words and clauses are sometimes wilfully
omitted for the sake of removing apparent difficulties (e.g. υἱοῦ
βαραχίου, Matt, xxiii. 35 in Cod. א and a few others), and that
the negligent loss of whole passages through ὁμοιοτέλευτον is
common to manuscripts of every age and character. On the
whole, therefore, the indiscriminate rejection of portions of the
text regarded as supplementary, on the evidence of but a few
authorities, must be viewed with considerable distrust and
suspicion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. That reading of a passage is preferable which best suits
the peculiar style, manner, and habits of thought of an author;
it being the tendency of copyists to overlook the idiosyncrasies
of the writer. For example, the abrupt energy of St. James'
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">asyndeta</span></span> (e.g. ch. i. 27), of which we have just seen a marked
instance, is much concealed by the particles inserted by the
common text (e.g. ch. ii. 4, 13; iii. 17; iv. 2; v. 6): St. Luke in
the Acts is fond of omitting <span class="tei tei-q">“said”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“saith”</span> after the word
indicating the speaker, though they are duly supplied by recent
scribes (e.g. ch. ii. 38; ix. 5; xix. 2; xxv. 22; xxv. 28, 29).
Thus again, in editing Herodotus, an Ionic form is more eligible
than an Attic one equally well attested, while in the Greek
Testament an Alexandrian termination should be chosen under
similar circumstances. Yet even this canon has a double edge:
habit or the love of critical correction will sometimes lead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the scribe to change the text to his author's more usual
style, as well as to depart from it through inadvertence (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
Acts iv. 17; 1 Pet. ii. 24): so that we may securely apply
the rule only where the external evidence is not unequally
balanced.

V. Attention must be paid to the genius and usage of each
several authority, in assigning the weight due to it in a particular
instance. Thus the testimony of Cod. B is of the less
influence in omissions, that of Cod. D (Bezae) in additions, inasmuch
as the tendency of the former is to abridge, that of the
latter to amplify the sacred text. The value of versions and
ecclesiastical writers also much depends on the degree of care
and critical skill which they display.

VI. <span class="tei tei-q">“Inter plures unius loci lectiones ea pro suspectâ merito
habetur, quae orthodoxorum dogmatibus manifestè prae ceteris
favet”</span> (Griesbach, N. T., Proleg., p. lxvi. vol. i). I cite this canon
from Griesbach for the sake of annexing Archbishop Magee's
very pertinent corollary: <span class="tei tei-q">“from which, at least, it is reasonable
to infer, that whatever readings, in favour of the Orthodox
opinion, may have had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> sanction, have not been preferred by
him from any bias in behalf of Orthodoxy”</span> (Discourses on
Atonement and Sacrifice, vol. iii. p. 212). Alford says that
the rule, <span class="tei tei-q">“sound in the main,”</span> does not hold good, when,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whichever reading is adopted, the orthodox meaning is
legitimate</span></em>, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the adoption of the stronger orthodox reading is
absolutely incompatible with the heretical meaning</span></em>,—then it is
probable that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such stronger orthodox reading was the original</span></em>”</span>

xx. 28, where the weaker reading τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ κυρίου would
quite satisfy the orthodox, while the alternative reading τοῦ θεοῦ
<span class="tei tei-q">“would have been certain to be altered by the heretics.”</span> But
in truth there seems no good ground for believing that the rule
is <span class="tei tei-q">“sound in the main,”</span> though two or three such instances as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

seem to countenance it. We dissent altogether from Griesbach's
statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“Scimus enim, lectiones quascunque, etiam manifestò
falsas, dummodo orthodoxorum placitis patrocinarentur, inde
a tertii seculi initiis mordicus defensas seduloque propagatas,

nil praesidii afferrent, haereticorum perfidiae attributas temere
fuisse”</span> (Griesb. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ubi supra</span></span>), if he means that the orthodox
forged those great texts, which, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">believing them to be authentic</span></em>,
it was surely innocent and even incumbent on them to employ<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a>.
The Church of Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“inde a tertii seculi initiis”</span> has had her
faults, many and grievous, but she never did nor shall fail in her
duty as a faithful <span class="tei tei-q">“witness and keeper of Holy Writ.”</span> But
while vindicating the copyists of Scripture from all wilful
tampering with the text, we need not deny that they, like
others of their craft, preferred that one out of several extant
readings that seemed to give the fullest and most emphatic sense:
hence Davidson would fain account for the addition ἐκ τῆς
σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ (which, however, is not
unlikely to be genuine<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>) in Eph. v. 30. Since the mediaeval
scribes belonged almost universally to the monastic orders, we
will not dispute the truth of Griesbach's rule, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lectio prae aliis
sensum pietati (praesertim monasticae) alendae aptum fundens,
suspecta est,”</span> though its scope is doubtless very limited<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a>. Their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
habit of composing and transcribing Homilies has also been
supposed to have led them to give a hortatory form to positive
commands or dogmatic statements (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Vol. I. p. 17), but there is
much weight in Wordsworth's remark, that <span class="tei tei-q">“such suppositions as

and if such surmises were true, those MSS. would hardly be
worth the pains of collating them”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">note on</span></span> 1 Cor. xv. 49).

<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diplomatic</span></em>”</span> testimony of codices, versions, &amp;c. This species of
evidence, which can hardly be deemed internal, must have considerable
influence in numerous cases, and will be used the most
skilfully by such as have considerable practical acquaintance
with the rough materials of criticism. We have anticipated
what can be laid before inexperienced readers on this topic in
the first chapter of our first volume, when discussing the
sources of various readings<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a>: in fact, so far as canons of internal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or of paradiplomatic evidence are at all trustworthy, they
instruct us in the reverse process to that aimed at in Vol. I.
Chap. I; the latter showing by what means the pure text of
the inspired writings was brought into its present state of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial</span></em> corruption, the former promising us some guidance
while we seek to retrace its once downward course back to
the fountain-head of primeval truth<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>. To what has been
previously stated in regard to paradiplomatic testimony it
may possibly be worth while to add Griesbach's caution
<span class="tei tei-q">“lectiones <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">rhythmi</span></span> fallaciâ facillimè explicandae nullius sunt
pretii”</span> (N. T., Proleg. p. lxvi), a fact whereof 2 Cor. iii. 3
affords a memorable example. Here what once seemed the
wholly unnatural reading ἐν πλαξὶ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">καρδίαις</span></em> σαρκίναις, being
disparaged by dint of the rhyming termination, is received by
Lachmann in the place of καρδίας, on the authority of Codd. AB
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>) CDEGLP, perhaps a majority of cursive copies (seven
out of Scrivener's twelve, and Wake 12 or Paul. 277); to which
add Cod. א unknown to Lachmann, and that abject slave of
manuscripts, the Harkleian Syriac. Codd. FK have καρδίας,
with all the other versions. If we attempt to interpret καρδίαις,
we must either render with Alford, in spite of the order of the
Greek, <span class="tei tei-q">“on fleshy tables, [your] hearts:”</span> or with the Revisers
of 1881 <span class="tei tei-q">“in tables <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that are</span></em> hearts of flesh;”</span> yet surely σαρκίναις
as well as λιθίναις must agree with πλαξί. Dr. Hort in mere
despair would almost reject the second πλαξί (Introd., Notes,
p. 119).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been said that <span class="tei tei-q">“when the cause of a various reading
is known, the variation usually disappears<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a>.”</span> This language
may seem extravagant, yet it hardly exaggerates what may be
effected by internal evidence, when it is clear, simple, and
unambiguous. It is, therefore, much to be lamented that this
is seldom the case in practice. Readings that we should uphold
in virtue of one canon, are very frequently (perhaps in a majority
of really doubtful passages) brought into suspicion by means of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
another; yet they shall each of them be perfectly sound and
reasonable in their proper sphere. An instance in point is
Matt. v. 22, where the external evidence is divided. Codd. אΒ
(in Δ <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">secundâ manu</span></span>), 48, 198, 583, 587, Origen <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>, the
Ethiopic and Vulgate, omit εἰκῆ after πᾶς ὁ ὀργιζόμενος τῷ
ἀδελφῷ ἀυτοῦ, Jerome fairly stating that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“in quibusdam
codicibus,”</span> not <span class="tei tei-q">“in veris,”</span> which may be supposed to be Origen's
MSS., and therefore removing it from his revised Latin
version. It is found, however, in all other extant copies
(including ΣDEKLMSUVΔ (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>) Π, most cursives, all
the Syriac (the Peshitto inserting, not a Syriac equivalent, but
the Greek word εἰκῆ) and Old Latin copies, the Bohairic,
Armenian, and Gothic versions), in Eusebius, in many Greek
Fathers, in the Latin Fathers from Irenaeus downwards<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a>, and
even in the Old Latin Version of Origen himself; the later
authorities uniting with Codd. ΣD and their associates against
the two oldest manuscripts extant. Under such circumstances
the suggestions of internal evidence would be precious
indeed, were not that just as equivocal as diplomatic proof.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Griesbach and Meyer,”</span> says Dean Alford, <span class="tei tei-q">“hold it to have been
expunged from motives of moral rigorism:—De Wette to have

Our sixth Canon is here opposed to our first<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a>. The important
yet precarious and strictly auxiliary nature of rules of internal
evidence will not now escape the attentive student; he may
find them exemplified very slightly and imperfectly in the
twelfth Chapter of this volume, but more fully by recent
critical editors of the Greek Testament; except perhaps by
Tregelles, who usually passes them by in silence, though to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some extent they influence his decisions; by Lachmann, in the
formation of whose provisional text they have had no share; and
by Dean Burgon, who held that <span class="tei tei-q">“we must resolutely maintain,
that External Evidence must after all be our best, our only safe
guide”</span> (The Revision Revised, p. 19)<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>. We will close this
investigation by citing a few of those crisp little periods (conceived
in the same spirit as our own remarks) wherewith
Davidson is wont to inform and sometimes perhaps to amuse
his admirers:

An adequate discussion of the subject of the present chapter
would need a treatise by itself, and has been the single
theme of several elaborate works. We shall here limit ourselves
to the examination of those more prominent topics, a clear
understanding of which is essential for the establishment of
trustworthy principles in the application of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> evidence to

1. It was stated at the commencement of this volume that
the autographs of the sacred writers <span class="tei tei-q">“perished utterly in the
very infancy of Christian history:”</span> nor can any other conclusion
be safely drawn from the general silence of the earliest Fathers,
and from their constant habit of appealing to <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient and
approved copies<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>,”</span> when a reference to the originals, if extant,
would have put an end to all controversy on the subject of
various readings. Dismissing one passage in the genuine
Epistles of Ignatius (d. 107), which has no real connexion with
the matter<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a>, the only allusion to the autographs of Scripture
met with in the primitive ages is the well-known declaration of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Tertullian (fl. 200): <span class="tei tei-q">“Percurre Ecclesias Apostolicas, apud quas
ipsae adhuc Cathedrae Apostolorum suis locis praesident, apud
quas ipsae Authenticae Literae eorum recitantur, sonantes vocem,
et repraesentantes faciem uniuscujusque. Proximè est tibi Achaia,
habes Corinthum. Si non longè es a Macedoniâ, habes Philippos,
habes Thessalonicenses. Si potes in Asiam tendere, habes
Ephesum. Si autem Italiae adjaces, habes Romam ...”</span> (De
Praescriptione Haereticorum, c. 36.) Attempts have been made,
indeed, and that by eminent writers, to reduce the term <span class="tei tei-q">“Authenticae
Literae”</span> so as to mean nothing more than <span class="tei tei-q">“genuine,
unadulterated Epistles,”</span> or even the authentic Greek as opposed
to the Latin translation<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a>. It seems enough to reply with
Ernesti, that any such non-natural sense is absolutely excluded
by the word <span class="tei tei-q">“ipsae,”</span> which would be utterly absurd, if <span class="tei tei-q">“genuine”</span>
only were intended (Institutes, Pt. iii. Ch. ii. 3)<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>: yet the
African Tertullian was too little likely to be well informed on
this subject, to entitle his rhetorical statement to any real
attention<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a>. We need not try to explain away his obvious
meaning, but we may fairly demur to the evidence of this
honest, but impetuous and wrong-headed man. We have no
faith in the continued existence of autographs which are vouched
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

2. Besides the undesigned and, to a great extent, unavoidable
differences subsisting between manuscripts of the New Testament
within a century of its being written, the wilful corruptions
introduced by heretics soon became a cause of loud complaint in
the primitive ages of the Church<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a>. Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth,
addressing the Church of Rome and Soter its Bishop (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 168-176),
complains that even his own letters had been tampered
with: καὶ ταύτας οἱ τοῦ διαβόλου ἀπόστολοι ζιζανίων γεγέμικαν, ἃ μὲν
ἐξαιροῦντες, ἃ δὲ προστιθέντες; οἷς τὸ οὐαὶ κεῖται: adding, however,
the far graver offence, οὐ θαυμαστὸν ἄρα εἰ καὶ τῶν κυριακῶν ῥαδιουργῆσαί
τινες ἐπιβέβληνται γραφῶν (Euseb., Eccl. Hist., iv. 23),
where αἱ κυριακαὶ γραφαί can be none other than the Holy
Scriptures. Nor was the evil new in the age of Dionysius. Not
to mention Asclepiades, or Theodotus, or Hermophylus, or Apollonides,
who all under the excuse of correcting the sacred text
corrupted it<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a>, or the Gnostics Basilides (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 130?) and Valentinus
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 150?) who published additions to the sacred text which
were avowedly of their own composition, Marcion of Pontus, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
arch-heretic of that period, coming to Rome on the death of its
Bishop Hyginus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 142)<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a>, brought with him that mutilated and
falsified copy of the New Testament, against which the Fathers
of the second century and later exerted all their powers, and
whose general contents are known to us chiefly through the
writings of Tertullian and subsequently of Epiphanius. It can
hardly be said that Marcion deserves very particular mention in
relating the history of the sacred text<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>. Some of the variations
from the common readings which his opponents detected were
doubtless taken from manuscripts in circulation at the time, and,
being adopted through no private preferences of his own, are
justly available for critical purposes. Thus in 1 Thess. ii. 15,
Tertullian, who saw only τοὺς προφήτας in his own copies, objects
to Marcion's reading τοὺς ἰδίους προφήτας (<span class="tei tei-q">“licet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suos</span></em> adjectio sit
haeretici”</span>), although ἰδίους stands in the received text, in Evann.
KL (DE in later hands) and all cursives except eight, in the
Gothic and both (?) Syriac versions, in Chrysostom, Theodoret,
and John Damascenus. Here the heretic's testimony is useful in
showing the high antiquity of ἰδίους, even though אABDEFGP,
eight cursives, Origen thrice, the Vulgate, Armenian, Ethiopic,
and all three Egyptian versions, join with Lachmann, Tischendorf,
Tregelles, Westcott and Hort in rejecting it, some of them
perhaps in compliance with Tertullian's decision. In similar
instances the evidence of Marcion, as to matters of fact to which
he could attach no kind of importance, is well worth recording<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a>:
but where on the contrary the dogmas of his own miserable
system are touched, or no codices or other witnesses countenance
his changes (as is perpetually the case in his edition of St. Luke,
the only Gospel—and that maimed or interpolated from the
others—he seems to have acknowledged at all), his blasphemous
extravagance may very well be forgotten. In such cases he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
does not so much as profess to follow anything more respectable
than the capricious devices of his misguided fancy.

3. Nothing throws so strong a light on the real state of
the text in the latter half of the second century as the single
notice of Irenaeus (fl. 178) on Apoc. xiii. 18. This eminent
person, the glory of the Western Church in his own age, whose
five books against Heresies (though chiefly extant but in a bald
old Latin version) are among the most precious reliques of
Christian antiquity, had been privileged in his youth to enjoy
the friendly intercourse of his master Polycarp, who himself had
conversed familiarly with St. John and others that had seen the
Lord (Euseb., Eccl. Hist., v. 20). Yet even Irenaeus, though
removed but by one stage from the very Apostles, possessed (if
we except a bare tradition) no other means of settling discordant
readings than are now open to ourselves; namely, to search out
the best copies and exercise the judgement on their contents.
His <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus classicus</span></span> must needs be cited in full, the Latin throughout,
the Greek in such portions as survive. The question is
whether St. John wrote χξιϛ᾽ (666), or χιϛ᾽ (616).

attention (fl. 194). Though his works abound with citations
from Scripture, on the whole not too carefully made (<span class="tei tei-q">“in adducendis

Mill, Proleg. § 627), the most has not yet been made of the
information he supplies. He too complains of those who tamper
with (or metaphrase) the Gospels for their own sinister ends, and
affords us one specimen of their evil diligence<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a>. His pupil
Origen's [185-253] is the highest name among the critics and
expositors of the early Church; he is perpetually engaged in the
discussion of various readings of the New Testament, and
employs language in describing the then existing state of the
text, which would be deemed strong if applied even to its present
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
condition, after the changes which sixteen more centuries must
needs have produced. His statements are familiar enough to
Biblical enquirers, but, though often repeated, cannot be rightly
omitted here. Seldom have such warmth of fancy and so bold
a grasp of mind been united with the life-long patient industry
which procured for this famous man the honourable appellation
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adamantius</span></span>. Respecting the sacred autographs, their fate
or their continued existence, he seems to have had no information,
and to have entertained no curiosity: they had simply passed by
and were out of reach. Had it not been for the diversities of
copies in all the Gospels on other points (he writes)—καὶ εἰ μὲν
μὴ καὶ περὶ ἄλλων πολλῶν διαφωνία ἦν πρὸς ἄλληλα τῶν ἀντιγράφων—he
should not have ventured to object to the authenticity of
a certain passage (Matt. xix. 19) on internal grounds: νυνὶ δὲ

5. Nor can it easily be denied that the various readings of
the New Testament current from the middle of the second to the
middle of the third century, were neither fewer nor less considerable
than such language would lead us to anticipate. Though no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
surviving manuscript of the Old Latin version, or versions, dates
before the fourth century, and most of them belong to a still
later age, yet the general correspondence of their text with that
used by the first Latin Fathers is a sufficient voucher for its
high antiquity. The connexion subsisting between this Latin
version, the Curetonian Syriac, and Codex Bezae, proves that
the text of these documents is considerably older than the vellum
on which they are written; the Peshitto Syriac also, most probably
the very earliest of all translations, though approaching
far nearer to the received text than they, sufficiently resembles
these authorities in many peculiar readings to exhibit the general
tone and character of one class of manuscripts extant in the
second century, two hundred years anterior to Codd. אB. Now
it may be said without extravagance that no set of Scriptural
records affords a text less probable in itself or less sustained by
any rational principles of external evidence, than that of Cod.
D, of the Latin codices, and (so far as it accords with them) of
Cureton's Syriac. Interpolations, as insipid in themselves as
unsupported by other evidence, abound in them all<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>: additions
so little in accordance with the genuine spirit of Holy Writ that
some critics (though I, for one, profess no skill in such alchemy)
have declared them to be as easily separable from the text which
they encumber, as the foot-notes appended to a modern book are
from the main body of the work (Tregelles, An Account of the
Printed Text, p. 138, note). It is no less true to fact than paradoxical
in sound, that the worst corruptions to which the New
Testament has ever been subjected, originated within a hundred
years after it was composed; that Irenaeus and the African
Fathers and the whole Western, with a portion of the Syrian
Church, used far inferior manuscripts to those employed by
Stunica, or Erasmus, or Stephen thirteen centuries later, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moulding the Textus Receptus. What passage in the Holy
Gospels would be more jealously guarded than the record of the
heavenly voice at the Lord's Baptism? Yet Augustine (De Consensu
Evangelist, ii. 14) marked a variation which he thought
might be found <span class="tei tei-q">“in aliquibus fide dignis exemplaribus,”</span> though
not <span class="tei tei-q">“in antiquioribus codicibus Graecis,”</span> where, in the place of
ἐν σοὶ ἠυδόκησα (Luke iii. 22), the words ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε
are substituted from Psalm ii. 7: so also reads the Manichaean
Faustus apud Augustin.; Enchiridion ad Laurentium, c. 49.
The only Greek copy which maintains this important reading is
D: it is met with moreover in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abc</span></span> (in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span> of course), in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">1</span></span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ
manu</span></span>, and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span>, whose united evidence leaves not a doubt of its
existence in the primitive Old Latin; whence it is cited by Hilary
three times, by Lactantius and Juvencus, to which list Abbot
adds Hilary the deacon (Quaestiones V. et N. T.). Among the
Greeks it is known but to Methodius, and to those very early
writers, Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria, who seem to
have derived the corruption (for such it must doubtless be
regarded) from the Ebionite Gospel (Epiphan., Haeres., xxi. 13)<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>.
So again of a doubtful passage which we shall examine in
Chapter <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>, Irenaeus cites Acts viii. 37 without the least
misgiving, though the spuriousness of the verse can hardly be
doubted; and expressly testifies to a reading in Matt. i. 18 which
has not till lately found many advocates. It is hard to believe
that 1 John v. 7, 8 was not cited by Cyprian, and even the
interpolation in Matt. xx. 28 was widely known and received.
Many other examples might be produced from the most venerable
Christian writers, in which they countenance variations
(and those not arbitrary, but resting on some sort of authority)
which no modern critic has ever attempted to vindicate.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. When we come down to the fourth century, our information
grows at once more definite and more trustworthy. Copies
of Scripture had been extensively destroyed during the long
and terrible period of affliction that preceded the conversion of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Constantine. In the very edict which marked the beginning
of Diocletian's persecution, it is ordered that the holy writings
should be burnt (τὰς γραφὰς ἀφανεῖς πυρὶ γενέσθαι, Eusebius,
Eccl. Hist., viii. 2); and the cruel decree was so rigidly enforced
that a special name of reproach (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">traditores</span></span>), together with the
heaviest censures of the Church, was laid upon those Christians
who betrayed the sacred trust (Bingham, Antiquities, book xvi.
ch. vi. 25). At such a period critical revision or even the
ordinary care of devout transcribers must have disappeared
before the pressure of the times. Fresh copies of the New
Testament would have to be made in haste to supply the room
of those seized by the enemies of our Faith; and, when made,
they had to circulate by stealth among persons whose lives were
in jeopardy every hour. Hence arose the need, when the
tempest was overpast, of transcribing many new manuscripts of
the Holy Bible, the rather as the Church was now receiving vast
accessions of converts within her pale. Eusebius of Caesarea,
the ecclesiastical historian, seems to have taken the lead in
this happy labour; his extensive learning, which by the aid of
certain other less commendable qualities had placed him high
in Constantine's favour, rendered it natural that the emperor
should employ his services for furnishing with fifty copies of
Scripture the churches of his new capital, Constantinople.
Eusebius' deep interest in Biblical studies is exhibited in
several of his surviving works, as well as in his Canons for
harmonizing the Gospels: and he would naturally betake himself
for the text of his fifty codices to the Library founded at
his Episcopal city of Caesarea by the martyr Pamphilus, the
dear friend and teacher from whom he derived his own familiar
appellation <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius Pamphili</span></span>. Into this Library Pamphilus
had gathered manuscripts of Origen as well as of other
theologians, and of these Eusebius made an index (τοὺς πίνακας
παρεθέμην: Eccles. Hist., vi. 32). From this collection Cod. H of
St. Paul and others are stated to have been derived, nay
even Cod. א in its Old Testament portion (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> vol. I. p. 55 and
note), which is expressly declared to have been corrected to the
Hexapla of Origen. Indeed we know from Jerome (Comment.
in Epist. ad Tit.) that the very autograph (<span class="tei tei-q">“ipsa authentica”</span>) of
Origen's Hexapla was used by himself at Caesarea, and Montfaucon
(Praeliminaria in Hexapl., chap. i. 5) cites from one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
manuscript the following subscription to Ezekiel, Ὁ Εὐσέβιος
ἐγὼ σχόλια παρέθηκα. Πάμφιλος καὶ Εὐσέβιος ἐδιωρθώσαντο.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. We are thus warranted, as well from direct evidence as
from the analogy of the Old Testament, to believe that Eusebius
mainly resorted for his Constantinopolitan Church-books to the
codices of Pamphilus, which might once have belonged to
Origen. What critical corrections (if any) he ventured to make
in the text on his own judgement is not so clear. Not that there
is the least cause to believe, with Dr. Nolan (Inquiry into the
Integrity of the Greek Vulgate, p. 27), that Eusebius had either
the power or the will to suppress or tamper with the great
doctrinal texts 1 John v. 7, 8; 1 Tim. iii. 16; Acts xx. 28; yet
we cannot deny that his prepossessions may have tempted him
to arbitrary alterations in other passages, which had no direct
bearing on the controversies of his age<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a>. Codd. אB are quite
old enough to have been copied under his inspection<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>, and it is
certainly very remarkable that these two early manuscripts omit
one whole paragraph (Mark xvi. 9-20) with his sanction, if
not after his example (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below, Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>). Thus also in
Matt, xxiii. 35 Cod. א, with the countenance only of Evan. 59,
Evst. 6, 13, 222 (see under Evst. 222), discards υἱοῦ βαραχίον, for
which change Eusebius (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">silentio</span></span>) is literally the only authority
among the Fathers, Irenaeus and even Origen retaining the
words, in spite of their obvious difficulty. The relation in which
Cod. א stands to the other four chief manuscripts of the Gospels,
may be roughly estimated from analyzing the transcript of four
pages first published by Tischendorf<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>, as well as in any other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
way. Of the 312 variations from the common text therein
noted, א stands alone in forty-five, in eight agrees with ABCD
united (much of C, however, is lost in these passages), with ABC
together thirty-one times, with ABD fourteen, with AB thirteen,
with D alone ten, with B alone but once (Mark i. 27), with C
alone once: with several authorities against AB thirty-nine times,
with A against B fifty-two, with B against A ninety-eight.
Hence, while the discovery of this precious document has
unquestionably done much to uphold Cod. B (which is the more
correctly written, and doubtless the more valuable of the two) in
many of its more characteristic and singular readings, it has
made the mutual divergencies of the very oldest critical
authorities more patent and perplexing than ever<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>.

8. Codd. אB were apparently anterior to the age of Jerome,
the latest ecclesiastical writer whose testimony need be dwelt
upon, since from his time downwards the stream of extant and
direct manuscript evidence, beginning with Codd. AC, flows on
without interruption. Jerome's attention was directed to the
criticism of the Greek Testament by his early Biblical studies,
and the knowledge he thus obtained had full scope for its
exercise when he was engaged on revising the Old Latin version.
In his so-often cited <span class="tei tei-q">“Praefatio ad Damasum,”</span> prefixed to his
recension of the Gospels, he complains of certain <span class="tei tei-q">“codices, quos
a Luciano et Hesychio nuncupatos, paucorum hominum asserit
perversa contentio,”</span> and those not of the Old Testament alone,
but also of the New. This obscure and passing notice of corrupt
and (apparently) interpolated copies has been made the foundation
of more than one theory as fanciful as ingenious. Jerome
further informs us that he had adopted in his translation the
canons which Eusebius <span class="tei tei-q">“Alexandrium secutus Ammonium”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">but
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
see</span></span> Vol. I. pp. 59, &amp;c.) had invented or first brought into vogue;
stating, and, in his usual fashion, somewhat exaggerating<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a>, an
evil these canons helped to remedy, the mixing up of the matter
peculiar to one Evangelist with the narrative of another.
Hence we might naturally expect that the Greek manuscripts
he would view with special favour, were the same as Eusebius
had approved before him. In the scattered notices throughout
his works, Jerome sometimes speaks but vaguely of <span class="tei tei-q">“quaedam
exemplaria tam Graeca quam Latina”</span> (Luke xxii. 43-4, almost
in the words of Hilary, his senior); or appeals to readings <span class="tei tei-q">“in
quibusdam exemplaribus et maximè in Graecis codicibus”</span>
(Mark xvi. 14). Occasionally we hear of <span class="tei tei-q">“multi et Graeci et
Latini codices”</span> (John vii. 53), or <span class="tei tei-q">“vera exemplaria”</span> (Matt. v. 22;
xxi. 31), or <span class="tei tei-q">“antiqua exemplaria”</span> (Luke ix. 23), without
specifying in which language: Mark xvi. 9-20 <span class="tei tei-q">“in raris fertur
Evangeliis,”</span> since <span class="tei tei-q">“omnes Graeciae libri paene”</span> do not contain
it<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>. In two places, however, he gives a more definite account
of the copies he most regarded. In Galat. iii. 1 τῇ ἀληθείᾳ μὴ
πείθεσθαι is omitted by Jerome, because it is not contained <span class="tei tei-q">“in
exemplaribus Adamantii,”</span> although (as he elsewhere informs
us) <span class="tei tei-q">“et Graeca exemplaria hoc errore confusa sint.”</span> In the
other of the two passages Jerome remarks that in some
Latin copies of Matt. xxiv. 36 <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">neque filius</span></span> is added, <span class="tei tei-q">“quum
in Graecis, et maxime Adamantii et Pierii exemplaribus, hoc
non habeatur adscriptum.”</span> Pierius the presbyter of Alexandria,
elsewhere called by Jerome <span class="tei tei-q">“the younger Origen”</span> (Cat. Scriptt.
Eccl., i. p. 128), has been deprived by fortune of the honour
due to his merit and learning. A contemporary, perhaps the
teacher of Pamphilus (Euseb., Eccl. Hist., vii. 32) at Caesarea,
his copies of Scripture would naturally be preserved with those
of Origen in the great Library of that city. Here they were
doubtless seen by Jerome when, to his deep joy, he found
Origen's writings copied in Pamphilus' hand (Cat. Scriptt. Eccl.,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ubi supra</span></span>), which volumes Acacius and Euzoius, elder contemporaries
of Jerome himself, had taken pious care to repair
and renew (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> i. p. 131; ad Marcell. Ep. cxli). It is not
therefore wonderful if, employing as they did and setting
a high value on precisely the same manuscripts of the N. T.,
the readings approved by Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome should
closely agree.

9. Epiphanius [d. 403], who wrote at about the same period
as Jerome, distinguishes in his note on Luke xix. 41 or xxii. 44
(Tom. ii. p. 36) between the uncorrected copies (ἀδιορθώτοις), and
those used by the Orthodox<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>. Of the function of the <span class="tei tei-q">“corrector”</span>
(διορθωτής) of an ancient manuscript we have spoken several
times before: but a system was devised by Professor J. L. Hug
of Freyburg (Einleitung, 1808), and maintained, though with
some modifications, by J. G. Eichhorn, which assigned to these
occasional, and (as they would seem to be) unsystematic labours
of the reviser, a foremost place in the criticism of the N. T.
Hug conceived that the process of corruption had been going on
so rapidly and uniformly from the Apostolic age downwards,
that by the middle of the third century the state of the text in
the general mass of codices had degenerated into the form
exhibited in Codd. D, 1, 13, 69, 124 of the Gospels, the Old Latin
and Sahidic (he would now have added the Curetonian Syriac)
versions, and to some extent in the Peshitto and in the citations
of Clement of Alexandria and of Origen in his early works. To
this uncorrected text he gave the name of κοινὴ ἔκδοσις, and that
it existed, substantially in the interpolated shape now seen in
Cod. D, the Old Latin, and Cureton's Syriac, as early as the
second century, need not be doubted. There is some foundation
for this position, but it was marred by Hug's lack of sobriety of
judgement. What we may fairly dispute is that this text ever
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had extensive circulation or good repute in the Churches whose
vernacular language was Greek. This <span class="tei tei-q">“common edition”</span> Hug
supposes to have received three separate emendations in the
middle of the third century; one made by Origen in Palestine,
which he thinks Jerome adopted and approved; two others by
Hesychius and Lucian (a presbyter of Antioch and Martyr), in
Egypt and Syria respectively, both which Jerome condemned,
and Pope Gelasius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 492-6) declared to be apocryphal<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a>. To
Origen's recension he referred such copies as AKM, 42, 106, 114,
116, 253 of the Gospels, the Harkleian Syriac, the quotations
of Chrysostom and Theodoret; to Hesychius the Alexandrian
codices BCL; to Lucian the Byzantine documents EFGHSV and
the mass of later books. The practical effect of this elaborate
theory would be to accord to Cod. A a higher place among our
authorities than some recent editors have granted it, even than
it quite deserves, yet its correspondence with Origen in many
characteristic readings would thus be admitted and accounted
for (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">but see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg226" class="tei tei-ref">226</a>). But in truth Hug's whole scheme is utterly
baseless as regards historical fact, and most insufficiently sustained
by internal proof. Jerome's slight and solitary mention
of the copies of Lucian and Hesychius abundantly evinces their
narrow circulation and the low esteem in which they were held;
and even Eichhorn perceived that there was no evidence whatever
to show that Origen had attempted a formal revision of the
text. The passages cited above, both from Eusebius and Jerome—and
no others are known to bear on the subject—will carry
us no further than this:—that these Fathers had access to
codices of the N. T. once possessed by Adamantius, and here and
there, perhaps, retouched by his hand. The manuscripts copied
by Pamphilus were those of Origen's own works; and while we
have full and detailed accounts of what he accomplished for the
Greek versions of the Old Testament, no hint has been thrown
out by any ancient writer that he carried his pious labour into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the criticism of the New. On the contrary, he seems to disclaim
the task in a sentence now extant chiefly in the old Latin
version of his works, wherein, to a notice of his attempt to
remove diversity of reading from codices of the Septuagint by
the help of <span class="tei tei-q">“the other editions”</span> (κριτηρίῳ χρησάμενοι ταῖς λοιπαῖς
ἐκδόσεσιν, i.e. the versions of Aquila and the rest), he is
represented as adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“In exemplaribus autem Novi Testamenti,
hoc ipsum me posse facere sine periculo non putavi”</span>
(Origen, Tom. iii. p. 671).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Hug's system of recensions was devised as a corrective
to those of Bengel and of Griesbach, which have been adequately
discussed in Chapter <a href="#Chapter_VII" class="tei tei-ref">VII</a>. The veteran Griesbach spent his last
effort as a writer in bringing to notice the weak points of Hug's
case, and in claiming him, where he rightly could, as a welcome
ally<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a>. But neither did Hug's scheme, nor that propounded by
Scholz some years later, obtain the general credit and acceptance
which had once been conceded to Griesbach's. It was by this
time plainly seen that not only were such theories unsupported
by historical testimony (to which indeed the Professor of Halle
had been too wise to lay claim), but that they failed to account
for more than a part, and that usually a small part, of the
phenomena disclosed by minute study of our critical materials.
All that can be inferred from searching into the history of the
sacred text amounts to no more than this: that extensive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
variations, arising no doubt from the wide circulation of the
New Testament in different regions and among nations of diverse
languages, subsisted from the earliest period to which our records
extend. Beyond this point our investigations cannot be carried,
without indulging in pleasant speculations which may amuse the
fancy, but cannot inform the sober judgement. Such is the
conclusion to which we are reluctantly brought after examining
the principles laid down, as well by the critics we have named
above, as by Lachmann, by his disciple Tregelles, and even by
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">par nobile</span></span> of Cambridge Doctors, Professor Hort and Bishop
(formerly Canon) Westcott, of whose labours we shall speak
presently.

Yet is it true that we are thus cast upon the wide ocean
without a compass or a guide? Can no clue be found that
may conduct us through the tangled maze? Is there no other
method of settling the text of the New Testament than by
collecting and marshalling and scrutinizing the testimony of
thousands of separate documents, now agreeing, now at issue
with each other:—manuscripts, versions, ecclesiastical writers,
whose mutual connexion and interdependence, as far as they
exist (and to some extent they do and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> exist), defy all our
skill and industry to detect and estimate aright? This would
surely be a discouraging view of critical science as applied to the
sacred volume, and it is by no means warranted by proved and
admitted facts. Elaborate systems have failed, as might have
been looked for from the first. It was premature to frame them
in the present stage of things, while the knowledge we possess of
the actual contents of our extant authorities is imperfect, vague,
and fragmentary; while our conclusions are liable to be disturbed
from time to time by the rapid accession of fresh materials, of
whose character we are still quite ignorant. But if we be
incompetent to devise theories on a grand or imposing scale,
a more modest and a safer course is open. Men of the present
generation may be disqualified for taking a general survey of the
whole domain of this branch of divine learning, who may yet
be employed, serviceably and with honour, in cultivating each
one for himself some limited and humble field of special research,
to which his taste, his abilities, or opportunities have attached
him: those persons may usefully improve a farm, who cannot
hope to conquer a kingdom. Out of the long array of uncollated
manuscripts which swell our catalogues, let the student choose
from the mass a few within his reach which he may deem worthy
of complete examination; or exhaust the information some
ecclesiastical writer of the first six centuries can afford; or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contribute what he can to an exact acquaintance with some good
ancient version, ascertaining the genius of its language and
(where this is attainable) the literary history of its text. If, in
the course of such quiet toil, he shall mark (as a patient observer
will find cause to mark) resemblances and affinities more than
accidental, between documents of widely different ages and
countries; he will not only be contributing to the common stock
what cannot fail to be available hereafter as raw material, but
he will be helping to solve that great problem which has hitherto
in part eluded the most earnest inquiries, the investigation of
the true laws and principles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Comparative Criticism</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last-mentioned term has been happily applied by Tregelles
to that delicate and important process, whereby we seek to
determine the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comparative</span></em> value, and trace the mutual relation,
of authorities of every kind upon which the original text of the
N. T. is based. Thus explained (and in this enlarged sense
scholars have willingly accepted it), its researches may be
pursued with diligence and interest, without reference to the
maintenance or refutation of any particular system or scheme
of recensions. The mode of procedure is experimental and tentative,
rather than dogmatical; the facts it gradually develops
will eventually (as we trust) put us on the right road, although
for the present we meet with much that is uncertain, perplexing,
ambiguous. It has already enabled critics in some degree to
classify the documents with which they have to deal; it may
possibly lead them, at some future period, to the establishment
of principles more general, and therefore more simple, than we can
now conceive likely or even possible to be attained to.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. In the course of investigations thus difficult and precarious,
designed to throw light on a matter of such vast consequence as
the genuine condition of the text of Scripture, one thing would
appear at first sight almost too clear for argument, too self-evident
to be disputed,—that it is both our wisdom and our duty
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to weigh the momentous subject at issue in all its parts</span></em>, shutting
out from the mind no source of information which can reasonably
be supposed capable of influencing our decision. Nor can such
a course become less right or expedient because it must perforce
involve us in laborious, extensive, and prolonged examination of
a vast store of varied and voluminous testimony. It is essential
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that divines should strive to come to definite conclusions
respecting disputed points of sacred criticism; it is not necessary
that these conclusions should be drawn within a certain limited
period, either this year, or even in the lifetime of our generation.
Hence such a plan as that advocated by Lachmann, for abridging
the trouble of investigation by the arbitrary rejection of the great
mass of existing evidence, must needs be condemned for its rashness
by those who think their utmost pains well bestowed in
such a cause; nor can we consistently praise the determination
of others, who, shunning the more obvious errors into which
Lachmann fell, yet follow his example in constructing the text
of the N. T. on a foundation somewhat less narrow, but scarcely
more firm than his. As the true science of Biblical criticism is
in real danger of suffering harm from the efforts of disciples of
this school, it cannot be out of place if we examine the pleas
which have been urged in vindication of their scheme, and assign
(as briefly as we may) our reasons for believing that its apologists
are but labouring in vain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brevis vita, ars longa.</span></span> For this lawful cause, if for no
other, the most ardent student of Biblical criticism would fain
embrace some such system as is advocated by Lachmann and
his followers, if only it could be done in tolerable safety. The
process of investigation might thus be diminished twentyfold,
and the whole subject brought within a compass not too vast
for one man's diligence or the space of an ordinary lifetime.
The simplicity and comparative facility of this process of
resorting to the few for instruction hitherto supposed to be
diffused among the many, has created in its favour a strong and
not unnatural prejudice, which has yielded, so far as it has yet
yielded at all, to nothing but the stubborn opposition of indisputable
facts. It will also readily be admitted, that certain
principles, not indeed peculiar to this theory, but brought by it
into greater prominence, are themselves most reasonable and
true. No one will question, for example, that <span class="tei tei-q">“if the reading of
the ancient authorities in general is unanimous, there can be but
little doubt that it should be followed, whatever may be the
later testimonies; for it is most improbable that the independent
testimony of early MSS., versions, and Fathers should accord
with regard to something entirely groundless”</span> (Tregelles, N. T.,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Introductory Notice, p. 2). No living man, possessed of a tincture
of scholarship, would dream of setting up testimony exclusively
modern against the unanimous voice of antiquity. The point on
which we insist is briefly this:—that the evidence of ancient
authorities is anything but unanimous; that they are perpetually
at variance with each other, even if we limit the term ancient
within the narrowest bounds. Shall it include, among the
manuscripts of the Gospels, none but the five oldest copies Codd.
אABCD<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>? The reader has but to open the first recent critical
work he shall meet with, to see them scarcely ever in unison;
perpetually divided two against three, or perhaps four against
one. All the readings these venerable monuments contain must
of course be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient</span></em>, or they would not be found where they
are; but they cannot all be true. So again, if our search be
extended to the versions and primitive Fathers, the same phenomenon
unfolds itself, to our grievous perplexity and disappointment.
How much is contained in Cureton's Syriac and the Old
Latin for which no Greek original can now be alleged? Do not
the earliest ecclesiastical writers describe readings as existing
and current in their copies, of which few traces can be met with
at present<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a>? If the question be fairly proposed, <span class="tei tei-q">“What right
have we to set virtually aside the agreement in the main of our
oldest uncials, at the distance of one or two centuries—of
which, owing probably to the results of persecution, we have
no MS. remains—with the citations of the primitive Fathers,
and with the earliest versions?”</span>: the answer must be rendered,
without hesitation, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no right whatever</span></em>. Where the oldest of
these authorities really agree, we accept their united testimony
as practically conclusive. It is not at all our design to seek our
readings from the later uncials, supported as they usually are by
the mass of cursive manuscripts; but to employ their confessedly
secondary evidence in those numberless instances wherein their
elder brethren are hopelessly at variance<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>. We do not claim for
the recent documents the high consideration and deference fitly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reserved for a few of the oldest; just as little do we think it
right to pass them by in silence, and allow to them no more
weight or importance than if they had never been written.
<span class="tei tei-q">“There are passages,”</span> to employ the words of a very competent
judge, <span class="tei tei-q">“where the evidence of the better cursives may be of
substantial use in confirming a good reading, or in deciding us

assign the other to the margin<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. It may readily be supposed that the very few manuscripts
which, being ancient themselves, are regarded by the school of
Lachmann as alone preserving an ancient and genuine form, have
not been selected as virtually the sole authorities for the settling
of the sacred text, except for reasons which those who thus adopt
them regard as weighty, and which merit at any rate our best
consideration before we put them aside as insufficient. The
great uncials, we are told, are treated with so much deference,
not only or chiefly because they are old, but because they have
been rigorously tested and have proved on trial to deserve the
confidence which has been reposed in them. The process of
investigation shall now be stated, as fairly and even favourably
as possible. It is not worth while, as it certainly is not our
desire, to snatch a transient advantage by misrepresenting the
views we are controverting. We would rather comprise in our
own system all that is sound and exact in them, while we withstand
the attempt to carry them beyond the limits which they
may legitimately occupy, and refuse to generalize on the strength
of facts which are only partially true.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have already laid down the axiom admitted by all, that
manuscripts of the original hold the first rank among our critical
materials; versions, and, yet more, the citations of ecclesiastical
authors being subordinate to them. Yet whatever other disadvantages
the Patristic writings may labour under, we are at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any rate certain respecting the age in which they were composed,
the works themselves being assumed to be authentic. If Irenaeus,
or Tertullian, or Origen, expressly assure us that particular words
which they name were read in their copies of Scripture, we
cannot withstand their testimony that such words were really
found in manuscripts of the New Testament in the second and
third centuries, one or two hundred years before Codd. אB were
in existence. If, therefore, we take a various reading of the
text for which any one of these venerable men has vouched,
and observe that it is supported perhaps by a few manuscripts
of various ages, then by a version or two, especially if they be
natives of different countries, and flow together into the same
stream from sources remote from each other;—the rather too if
the reading be plausible and even probable in itself:—and if,
after having formed an opinion that on the whole it deserves to
be respectfully considered, we then turn to א or B, or to both,
and discover the same reading in them also:—not only has the
variation itself made out an urgent case for our acceptance, but
the character of א and B as faithful witnesses is largely enhanced.
It is moreover evident, that if the same method of investigation
be pursued many times over with the same, or something
approaching to the same success, the value of א and B as
truthful codices will be proportionally increased.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A single good example of this process will make it yet more
intelligible to the careful student. It shall be one that has been
chosen for the purpose by more than one of the advocates of the
system we are on the whole opposing. Of the two forms in
which the Lord's Prayer is delivered to us, Matt. vi. 13 has the
clause ἀλλὰ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ in every known authority:
in Luke xi. 4 the case is far otherwise. That Tertullian, when
citing the words before and after it, should take no notice of it,
would of itself prove little. Origen, however, once passes it by
in like manner, once more expressly declares that it was not in
St. Luke (παρὰ τῷ Λουκᾷ σεσιώπηται), a third time explains in his
most happy manner why it was omitted by the one Evangelist,
inserted by the other. The question thus raised sets us upon the
inquiry what other evidence we have for rejecting the clause in
St. Luke. It appears to be wanting in several Greek manuscripts,
such as L, 1, 22, 57, 130 both Greek and Latin, 131,
226*, 237, 242, 426, 582, 604, and in the catenas annexed to 36,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
237, 239, 253, 259, 426; several of these codices (as 57, 226,
242) not being much found in such company. It is absent from
the Vulgate version, and apparently from some forms of the Old
Latin, the rather as Augustine says that St. Luke gives five
petitions in the Lord's Prayer, St. Matthew seven, and attributes
the omission of our clause to some such reason as Origen had
assigned. It is omitted also in the Armenian version, which,
except for the later translation by Sahak from Syriac, might
be supposed to differ <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto caelo</span></span> from the Latin in country
and genius. The list is closed by the younger Cyril, a pure
witness from another region, very different lines of evidence
thus converging into one. Then comes the probability
that if one of the Gospels contained the Lord's Prayer in
a shorter form than the other, nothing was so likely as that
a scribe in perfect innocence would supply what he considered
an undoubted defect, without staying to reflect with Origen and
Augustine that the two were delivered on different occasions, to
different classes of persons, with different ends in view. Turning
therefore now, with a strong case already made out for the
omission of the clause, to א and B, which have been hitherto
kept out of sight, we find that B has not the disputed words at
all, nor had א by the first hand, but in one three centuries later.
The clear result, so far as it goes, is at once to vindicate the
claim of אB to high consideration, and to make out a formidable
case against the genuineness of the six words involved. We
say advisedly a formidable, not necessarily a fatal case, for the
counter evidence is still very strong, and comes as much as that
alleged above from different quarters, being also as early as widely
diffused. It consists of Codd. ACDEFGHKMR<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a>SUVΓΔΛΠ, of

Peshitto, Curetonian, Harkleian Syriac (the Jerusalem not containing
this week-day Lesson), and the Ethiopic versions. So
far as this side as stated is weak at all, it lacks Patristic evidence
(which cannot now be investigated for our purpose), and the
balance of internal evidence is decidedly adverse to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The student may try the same experiments on two other
passages often urged in this debate, Matt. v. 22, for which he
will find the materials above, p. <a href="#Pg255" class="tei tei-ref">255</a>, and Matt. xix. 17, which
will be discussed in Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>. We freely admit that these are
but a few out of many cases where the statements of ancient
writers about whose date there can be no question are borne out
by the readings of the more ancient codices, especially of א or B,
or of the two united. Undoubtedly this circumstance lends
a weight and authority to these manuscripts, and to the few
which side with them, which their mere age would not procure
for them: it does not entitle them to be regarded as virtually the
only documents worthy of being consulted in the recension of
the sacred text; as qualifying to be sole arbiters in critical
questions relating to the New Testament, against whose decision
there can be no appeal. Yet nothing less than this is claimed in
behalf of one or two of them by their devoted admirers. In
a court of justice, we are told, when once the evidence of
a witness has been thoroughly probed and tested, it is received
thenceforth as true, even on those points where it stands alone,
and in the face of strong antecedent improbabilities. Now
reasoning in metaphor has its advantages, as well for the sake of
clearly expressing our meaning, as of making an impression on
those we address; but it is attended with this grave inconvenience,
that, since the analogy between no two things that can
be compared is quite complete, we are sorely tempted to apply to
the one of them properties which appertain exclusively to the
other. In the present instance, besides the properties wherein
documentary can be assimilated to oral testimony, such as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
general accuracy and means of information, an important element
is present in the latter, to which the former has nothing
parallel, namely, moral character, that full persuasion of
a witness's good faith and disinterested integrity to which a jury
will often surrender, and rightly surrender, all earlier impressions
and predilections. Of this we can have nothing in the
case of the manuscripts of Scripture which we now possess. In
the second century we have seen too many instances of attempts
to tamper with the text of Scripture, some merely injudicious,
others positively dishonest; but all this was over long before
the scribes of the fourth and fifth centuries began their happy
task, as simple and honest copyists of the older records placed
before them. Let their testimony be received with attention at
all times; let it be accepted as conclusive whensoever there are
no grave reasons to the contrary, but let not their paramount
authority shut out all other considerations, external and internal,
which might guide us to the true reading of a passage; nor let
us be so illogical as to conclude, because א and B are sometimes
right, that therefore they never are in the wrong<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The results of this excessive and irrational deference to one of
our chief codices, that which he was so fortunate as to bring to
the light twenty-five years ago, appears plainly in Tischendorf's
eighth edition of the New Testament. That great critic had
never been conspicuous for stability of judgement. His third
edition was constructed almost without any reference to the
cursive manuscripts, which, unless they be, what no one asserts
or imagines, merely corrupt copies, or copies of copies, of existing
uncials, must needs be the representatives of yet older codices
which have long since perished: <span class="tei tei-q">“respectable ancestors”</span> (as one
has quaintly put the matter) <span class="tei tei-q">“who live only in their descendants”</span>
(Long, Ciceronis Verrin. Orat., Praef. p. vi)<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a>. In Tischendorf's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seventh edition, completed in 1859, that error was rectified, and
the sum of textual variations between the third and seventh
edition in consequence amounted to 1296, in no less than 595 of
which (430 of the remainder being mere matters of spelling) he
returned to the readings of the Received text, which he had
before deserted, but to which fresh materials and larger experience
had brought him back<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>. In the eighth edition another
disturbing element is introduced, and that edition differs from
his seventh in as many as 3369 places, to the scandal of the
science of Comparative Criticism, as well as to his own grave
discredit for discernment and consistency. The evidence of
Cod. א, supported or even unsupported by one or two authorities
of any description, proved with him sufficient to outweigh all
other witnesses, whether manuscripts, versions, or ecclesiastical
writers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The foregoing examination will probably have satisfied the
student that we have no right to regard Cod. B as a second
Infallible Voice proceeding from the Vatican, which, when it
has once spoken, must put an end to all strife. Yet nothing
less than this is claimed for it by writers, who yet have bestowed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
much thought and labour on this controversy. <span class="tei tei-q">“Seeing that
the Vatican manuscript does not contain one single passage that
can be demonstrated to be spurious, or that by the evidence of
other manuscripts and of the context, admits of just doubt as to
its authenticity, a position that no other manuscript enjoys, man
is bound to accept the testimony of that manuscript alone, as
his present text of the sacred record, wherever he possesses its
teaching<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a>.”</span> I am not sure whether, if we conceded this writer's
premisses, we should be bound to accept his conclusion; but the
easiest way of disposing of his argument, as well as of that of
persons, who, in heart agreeing with him, would hardly like to
enunciate their principle so broadly, is presently to lay before
the student a few readings of Cod. B, either standing alone, or
supported by א and others, respecting whose authenticity, or
rather genuineness, some of us must be forgiven if we cherish
considerable doubts. It is right, however, to declare that this
discussion is forced upon us through no wish to dissemble the
great value of the Codex Vaticanus, which in common with our
opponents we regard as the most weighty single authority that
we possess, but entirely by way of unavoidable protest against
a claim for supremacy set up in its behalf, which can belong of
right to no existing document whatsoever.

5. But indeed the theories of preceding critics, as well as the
practical application of those theories to the sacred text, have
been thrown into the shade by the more recent and elaborate
publications of Drs. Hort and Westcott, briefly noticed in a preceding
chapter, and claiming in this place our serious attention<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The system on which their text has been constructed has been
vindicated, so far as vindication was possible, in Dr. Hort's
<span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction,”</span> a very model of earnest reasoning, calling for and
richly rewarding the close and repeated study of all who would
learn the utmost that can be done for settling the text of the
New Testament on dogmatic principles. The germ of this
theory can be traced in the speculations of Bentley and Griesbach;
its authors would confess themselves on many points
disciples of Lachmann, although their process of investigation is
far more artificial than his. But there is little hope for the
stability of their imposing structure, if its foundations have been
laid on the sandy ground of ingenious conjecture: and since
barely the smallest vestige of historical evidence has ever been
alleged in support of the views of these accomplished editors,
their teaching must either be received as intuitively true, or
dismissed from our consideration as precarious, and even
visionary. This much said by way of preface, we will endeavour
to state the principles they advocate, as fairly and concisely as
we can.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(α) The books of the New Testament, even the Holy Gospels
themselves, could not well have been collected into one volume
till some time after the death of St. John. During this early
period, each portion of the inspired record would be circulated
separately, until at length the four Gospels would be brought
together in one book or Quaternion, and, since each component
member had to receive a distinctive appellation, the simplest and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the earliest headings would ascribe them to their respective
authors, κατὰ Ματθαῖον, κατὰ Μάρκον, κ.τ.λ., the general title of the
four being Εὐαγγέλιον. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is quite uncertain to what extent the
whole N. T. was ever included in a single volume in Ante-Nicene
times”</span> (Hort, Introduction, pp. 223, 268), only that the
Gospels had certainly been collected together when Justin Martyr
wrote his first Apology between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 139 and 150, inasmuch as
he appeals thrice over to the Memoirs of the Apostles, which he
once identifies with the Gospels (οἱ ἀπόστολοι ἐν τοῖς γενομένοις ὑπ᾽
ἀυτῶν ἀπομνημονεύμασιν ἃ καλεῖται εὐαγγέλια). Justin's disciple
Tatian, again, composed a Harmony of the Four (Διὰ τεσσάρων),
respecting the precise nature of which we have recently gained
very seasonable information. <span class="tei tei-q">“The idea, if not the name, of
a collective <span class="tei tei-q">‘Gospel’</span> is implied throughout the well-known
passage in the third book of Irenaeus, who doubtless received it
from earlier generations”</span> (Hort, p. 321). Hence it is not
unreasonable to suspect that our great codices (אABC), which
originally contained the whole N. T., may have been transcribed
in their several parts from copies differing from each other in
genius and in date. With such a possibility before us we ought
not to be perplexed if the character of the text whether of
Cod. A or of Cod. B differs in the Gospels from that which it
bears in the Acts and the Epistles; or if Cod. C in the Apocalypse,
and Cod. Δ in St. Mark, as has been already explained
under those MSS., appear to belong to a family or group apart
from that of the rest of their respective codices.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(β) At this remote period, during the first half of the second
century, must have originated the wide variations from the
prevailing text on the part of our primary authorities, both
manuscripts and versions, which survive in Cod. Bezae of the
Greek, and in the Old Latin codices or at least in some of them.
The text they exhibit is distinguished as Western, and they
have been joined by a powerful ally, the Curetonian Syriac.
Critics of every school agree in admitting the primitive existence
of this Western recension, and in their estimate of its general
spirit. <span class="tei tei-q">“The earliest readings which can be fixed chronologically
belong to it... But any prepossessions in its favour that
might be created by this imposing early ascendency are for the
most part soon dissipated by continuous study of its internal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
character”</span> (Hort, p. 120). <span class="tei tei-q">“The chief and most constant
characteristic of the Western readings is a love of paraphrase.
Words, clauses, and even whole sentences were changed, omitted,
and inserted with astonishing freedom, wherever it seemed that
the meaning could be brought out with greater force and definiteness”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 122). <span class="tei tei-q">“Another equally important characteristic
is a disposition to enrich the text at the cost of its purity by
alterations or additions taken from traditional and perhaps from
apocryphal and other non-biblical sources”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 123). Especially
may we note among other interpolations the long passage
after Matt. xx. 28 which we cited above, Vol. I. p. 8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(γ) We now come to the feature which distinguishes Dr.
Hort's system from any hitherto propounded; by the acceptance
or non-acceptance of which his whole edifice must stand or fall.
He seems to exaggerate the force of extant evidence when he
judges that the corrupt Western <span class="tei tei-q">“was the more widely-spread
text of Ante-Nicene times”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 120); but he tacitly assumes
that many codices, versions, and ecclesiastical writers remained
free from its malignant influence. The evidence of this latter
class was preserved comparatively pure until the middle of the
third century, when it was taken in hand, at some time between
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and 350, <span class="tei tei-q">“at what date it is impossible to say with
confidence, and even for conjecture the materials are scanty”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 137), by the Syrian bishops and Fathers of the
Patriarchate of Antioch, who undertook (1) <span class="tei tei-q">“an authoritative
revision at Antioch”</span> of the Greek text, which (2) was then
taken as a standard for a similar authoritative revision of the
Syriac text, and (3) was itself at a later time subjected to
a second authoritative revision, carrying out more completely
the purposes of the first (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 137). Of this twofold
authoritative revision of the Greek text, of this formal transmutation
of the Curetonian Syriac into the Peshitto (for this is
what Dr. Hort means, though his language is a little obscure),
although they must have been of necessity public acts of great
Churches in ages abounding in Councils General or Provincial,
not one trace remains in the history of Christian antiquity; no
one writer seems conscious that any modification either of the
Greek Scriptures or of the vernacular translation was made in
or before his time. It is as if the Bishops' Bible had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thrust out of the English Church service and out of the studies
of her divines, and the Bible of 1611 had silently taken its
place, no one knew how, or when, or why, or indeed that any
change whatever had been made. Yet regarding his speculative
conjecture as undubitably true, Dr. Hort proceeds to name the
text as it stood before his imaginary era of transfusion a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pre-Syrian</span></span>
text, and that into which it was changed, sometimes
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiochian</span></span>, more often <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Syrian</span></span><a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>; while of the latter recension,
though made deliberately, as our author believes, by the authoritative
voice of the Eastern Church, he does not shrink from
declaring that <span class="tei tei-q">“all distinctively Syrian readings must be at once
rejected”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 119), thus making a clean sweep of all critical
materials, Fathers, versions, manuscripts uncial or cursive, comprising
about nineteen-twentieths of the whole mass, which do
not correspond with his preconceived opinion of what a correct
text ought to be (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 163).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(δ) But one or two steps yet remain in this thorough
elimination of useless elements. A few authorities still survive
which are honoured as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pre-Syrian</span></span>, and continued unaffected
by the phantom revisions, which, for critical purposes, have
reduced their colleagues to ignominious silence. Besides the
Western, Dr. Hort has in reserve two other groups, the Alexandrian
and the Neutral. The former retains a text essentially
pure from Syrian (though not from Western) mixture, but its
component members are portentously few in number, being
tolerably void of corruption as regards the substance, with <span class="tei tei-q">“no
incorporation of matter extraneous to the canonical text of
the Bible, and no habitual or extreme license of paraphrase ...
the changes made having usually more to do with language than
with matter, and being marked by an effort after correctness
of phrase”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 131). There are no unmixed vouchers for
this Non-Western, Pre-Syrian, Alexandrian class, though Cyril
of Alexandria seems to come the nearest to purity (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 141),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then Origen, occasionally other Alexandrian Fathers, also the
Sahidic, and especially the Bohairic version (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 131).
No extant MS. has preserved so many Alexandrian readings as
Cod. L (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 153). Cod. C has some, T and Ξ more: in the
Gospels they are chiefly marked by the combination אCLXZ, 33
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 166). In Cod. A, for the Acts and Epistles, the
Alexandrian outnumber both the Syrian and Western readings
(Hort, p. 152), but they all are mere degenerations so far as
they depart from Dr. Hort's standard
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(ε) The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neutral</span></span> type of text: so called because it is free
from the glaring corruption of the Western, from the smooth
assimilations of the Syrian, and from the grammatical purism of
the Alexandrian. Only two documents come under this last
head, Codd. B and א, and of these two, when they differ, B is
preferable to א, which has a not inconsiderable Western element,
besides that the scribe's bold and rough manner has rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">“all the ordinary lapses due to rapid and careless transcription
more numerous”</span> than in B (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 246). Yet, with certain
slight exceptions which he carefully specifies, it is our learned
author's belief <span class="tei tei-q">“(1) that the readings of אB should be accepted
as the true readings until strong internal evidence is found to
the contrary, and (2) that no readings of אB can safely be
rejected absolutely, though it is sometimes right to place them
only on an alternative footing, especially where they receive no
support from Versions and Fathers”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 225): and this their
pre-eminence, in our critic's judgement, <span class="tei tei-q">“is due to the extreme,
and, as it were, primordial antiquity of the common original
from which the ancestries of the two MSS. have diverged, the
date of which cannot be later than the earlier part of the second
century, and may well be yet earlier”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 223).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That אB should thus lift up their heads against all the world
is much, especially having regard to the fact that several versions
and not a few Fathers are older than they: for, while we grant
that a simple patristic citation, standing by itself, is of little
value, yet when the context or current of exposition renders it
clear what reading these writers had before them, they must
surely for that passage be equivalent as authorities to a manuscript
of their own age. Nor will Dr. Hort allow us to make
any deduction from the weight of the united testimony of אB
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by reason of the curious fact, demonstrated as well to his satisfaction
(Hort, p. 213) as to our own, that the scribe of B
was the actual writer of parts of three distinct quires,
forming three pairs of conjugate leaves of א (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> above, p. <a href="#Pg096" class="tei tei-ref">96</a>,
note 1); but on this head we think he will find few readers to
agree with him. His devotion to Cod. B when it stands alone
is of necessity far more intelligent than that of the unnamed
writer mentioned already, yet we believe that his implied
confidence is scarcely the less misplaced. He is very glad when
he can to find friends for his favourite, and discusses with great
care the several binary combinations, such as BL, BC, BT, Bι,
BD (which last, indeed, is unsafe enough), AB, BZ, B 33 or BΔ
(for St. Mark) in the Gospels; AB, BC, &amp;c., in the rest of the
N. T. (Hort, p. 227). He does not disparage the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsingular</span></em>
readings of B, meaning by this convenient, perhaps novel, term,
the agreement of B with <span class="tei tei-q">“inferior Greek MSS., Versions, or
Fathers, or combinations of documentary evidence of these
kinds”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 230). But, when the worst comes to the worst,
and Cod. B is left absolutely alone, its advocates need not
despair, inasmuch as no readings of that manuscript, not
involving clerical error (and <span class="tei tei-q">“the scribe reached by no means
a high standard of accuracy,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 233), must be lightly or
hastily rejected, so powerfully do they commend themselves on
their own merits (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 238). This transcendent excellency,
however, belongs to it chiefly in the Gospels. In the Acts and
Catholic Epistles, if the value of A increases as has been said,
that of B is somewhat diminished; while in the Pauline Epistles
a <span class="tei tei-q">“local Western element of B”</span> (Hort, p. 240) brings it into the
less reputable company of DFG or even of D alone. Hence in
the formation of Westcott and Hort's Pauline text we sometimes
meet with what appears the paradoxical result that the evidence
of B alone is accepted, while that of B attended by other codices
is laid aside as insufficient.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is very instructive to compare the foregoing sketch of
Dr. Hort's system, brief and inadequate, yet not we trust unfair,
as it is, with the theory of Griesbach, for whose labours and
genius we share much of his successor's veneration. As regards
the modification of text called Western their views are nearly
identical, only that Griesbach was necessarily ignorant of such
important constituents of it as the Curetonian Syriac and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Old Latin codices which have come to light since his day, and
thus was exempted from the temptation to which Dr. Hort has
unhappily yielded, of believing that Codd. אB, with all their
comparative purity, represent a primitive text already corrupted
by certain accretions from which the Western copies were free
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below, p. <a href="#Pg299" class="tei tei-ref">299</a> and note 1): a violent supposition which
seriously impairs the homogeneousness and self-consistency of
his whole argument (Hort, pp. 175-6). Griesbach's Alexandrian
class includes not only that which Dr. Hort understands by the
name, but the later critic's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neutral</span></span> class also, which indeed we
fail to distinguish from the other by any marked peculiar
characteristics. The more mixed text which Griesbach called
Constantinopolitan, and which is represented by Cod. A in the
Gospels, in part by Cod. C, the Latin Vulgate, and later
authorities, differs from Dr. Hort's Syrian in much more than
name. Wider and deeper researches have made it evident that
Griesbach's notion of a gradual modernizing of the text used
from the fourth century downwards in the Patriarchate of
Constantinople, would not adequately account for the phenomena
wherewith we have to deal. The general, almost universal,
prevalence of such a departure from the readings of אB, met
with in ecclesiastical writers at least as early in date as the
parchment of those manuscripts themselves, can be explained by
nothing less than a comprehensive, deliberate, authoritative
recension of the sacred books, undertaken by the chief rulers of
the Antiochene Church, accepted throughout that great Patriarchate,
yet, in spite of all this, never noticed even in the way of
passing reference by writers of any description from that period
onwards, until its consequences, not its process, became known
to eminent critics in the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Nothing less than the exigency of his case could have driven
our author to encumber himself with a scheme fraught with
difficulties too great even for his skill to overcome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Hort's system, therefore, is entirely destitute of historical
foundation<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a>. He does not so much as make a show of pretending
to it: but then he would persuade us, as he has persuaded
himself, that its substantial truth is proved by results; and for
results of themselves to establish so very much, they must needs
be unequivocal, and admit of no logical escape from the conclusions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they lead up to. But is this really the case? <span class="tei tei-q">“Two
Members of the New Testament Company”</span> of Revisers, in
a temperate and very able pamphlet, have answered in the
affirmative, and have assigned, after Dr. Hort, but with greater
precision than he, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> reasons <span class="tei tei-q">“for the belief that the Syrian
text is posterior in origin to those which he calls Western,
Alexandrian, and Neutral”</span> (The Revisers and the Greek text of
the N. T., p. 25). Granting for our present purpose the reality
of this Syrian text, of whose independent existence we have
no direct proof whatever, let us see what the three reasons will
amount to.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(α) <span class="tei tei-q">“The first reason appears to us almost sufficient to settle
the question by itself. It is founded on the observation ... that
the Syrian text presents numerous instances of readings which,
according to all textual probability, must be considered to be
combinations of early readings still extant.”</span>... <span class="tei tei-q">“The reader
will find in Dr. Hort's own pages abundant illustration of the
fact in eight examples rigorously analyzed, which seem to supply
a proof, as positive as the subject admits, that Syrian readings
are posterior both to Western readings, and to other readings
which may be properly described as Neutral”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> pp. 25-6).
But the misfortune is that the subject does not admit of positive
proof; that what appears to one scholar <span class="tei tei-q">“textual probability,”</span>
appears to another a mere begging of the whole question. These
eight examples have been re-analyzed by Canon Cook (Revised
Version, pp. 205-18), and just before him by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly
Reviewer</span></span> (Revision Revised, pp. 258-65), writers not destitute
either of learning or of natural acuteness, who would fain lead us
to draw directly opposite inferences from Dr. Hort's. We will
take but one specimen, the eighth and last, to make our meaning
as clear as possible. <span class="tei tei-q">“This simple instance,”</span> says Dr. Hort
complacently, <span class="tei tei-q">“needs no explanation”</span> (Hort, p. 104).

The assumption of course is that the Syrian reading is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conflation</span></em>
of those of the other two classes, so forming a full
but not overburdened clause. But if this <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praejudicium</span></span> be
met with the plea that D and the Latins perpetually, B and
its allies very often, seek to abridge the sacred original, it would
be hard to demonstrate that the latter explanation is more
improbable than the former. Beyond this point of subjective
feeling the matter cannot well be carried, whether on one side
or the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Hort's other examples of conflation have the same double
edge as Luke xxiv. 53, and there is no doubt that Dr. Sanday is
right in asserting that like instances may be found wheresoever
they are looked for; but they prove nothing to any one who has
not made up his mind beforehand as to what the reading ought
to be. We have already confessed that there is a tendency on
the part of copyists to assimilate the narratives of the several
Gospels to each other; and that such Harmonies as that of
Tatian would facilitate the process; that synonymous words are
liable to be exchanged and harsh constructions supplied. Part
of the value of the older codices arises from their comparative
freedom from such corrections: but then this modernizing
process is on the part of copyists unsystematic, almost unconscious;
it is wholly different from the deliberate formal emendations
implied throughout Dr. Hort's volume.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(β) The second reason adduced by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Two Revisers</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“is
almost equally cogent”</span> in their estimation. It is that while
the Ante-Nicene Fathers <span class="tei tei-q">“place before us from separate and
in some cases widely distant countries examples of Western,
Alexandrian, and Neutral readings, it appears to be certain that
before the middle of the third century we have no historical
traces of readings which can properly be entitled distinctively
Syrian”</span> (The Revisers, &amp;c., p. 26). Now the middle of the
third century is the earliest period assigned by Dr. Hort for the
inception of his phantom scheme of Syrian revision, and we feel
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sure that the epoch of Patristic evidence was not put thus early,
in order to exclude Origen, whose support of his Alexandrian
readings Griesbach found so partial and precarious (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> above,
p. <a href="#Pg226" class="tei tei-ref">226</a>). In fact Dr. Hort expressly states that <span class="tei tei-q">“The only
period for which we have anything like a sufficiency of representative
knowledge consists roughly of three-quarters of
a century from about 175 to 250: but the remains of four
eminent Greek Fathers, which range through this period, cast
a strong light on textual history backward and forward. They
are Irenaeus, of Asia Minor, Rome, and Lyons; his disciple
Hippolytus, of Rome; Clement, of Athens and Alexandria; and
his disciple, Origen, of Alexandria and Palestine”</span> (Hort, p. 112).
Even if the extant writings of these Fathers had been as
rigorously examined and as thoroughly known as they certainly
are not, <span class="tei tei-q">“their scantiness and the comparative vagueness of the
textual materials contained in them”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>) would hinder our
drawing at present any positive conclusions regarding the sacred
text as known to them. Even the slender specimens of controverted
readings collected in our Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a> would suffice to
prove that their evidence is by no means exclusively favourable
to Dr. Hort's opinions, a fact for which we will allege but one
instance out of many, the support given to the Received text by
Hippolytus in that grand passage, John iii. 13<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are three considerable works relating to the criticism
of the N. T. still open to the enterprise of scholars, and they can
hardly be taken up at all except by the fresh hopefulness of
scholars yet young. We need a fuller and more comprehensive
collation of the cursive manuscripts (Hort, pp. 76-7): <span class="tei tei-q">“a complete
collection of all the fragments of the Thebaic New Testament
is now the most pressing want in the province of textual
criticism,”</span> writes Bp. Lightfoot, and he might have added
a better edition of the Bohairic also: but for the demands of the
present controversy we must set in the first rank the necessity
for a complete survey of the Patristic literature of the first five
centuries at the least. While we concede to Dr. Hort that as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a rule <span class="tei tei-q">“negative patristic evidence”</span>—that derived from the mere
silence of the writer, <span class="tei tei-q">“is of no force at all”</span> (Hort, p. 201), and
attach very slight importance to citations which are not express,
it is from this source that we must look for any stable decision
regarding the comparative purity in reference to the sacred
autographs of the several classes of documents which have
passed under our review.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(γ) Hence the second reason for supporting the text of
Westcott and Hort urged by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Two Revisers</span></span> relates to an
investigation of facts hitherto but partially ascertained: the
third, like the first, involves only matters of opinion, in which
individual judgements and prepossessions bear the chief part.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yet a third reason is supplied by Internal Evidence, or, in
other words, by considerations ... of intrinsic or of Transcriptional
Probability”</span> (The Revisers &amp;c., p. 26): and <span class="tei tei-q">“here,”</span> they
very justly add, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is obvious that we enter at once into
a very delicate and difficult domain of textual criticism, and can
only draw our conclusions with the utmost circumspection and
reserve”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>). On the subject of Internal Evidence enough for
our present purpose has been said, and Dr. Hort's Transcriptional
head appears to be Bp. Ellicott's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">paradiplomatic</span></span> under a more
convenient name. Our author's discussion of what he calls the
<span class="tei tei-q">“rudimental criticism”</span> of Internal evidence (Hort, Part ii.
pp. 19-72), if necessarily somewhat abstruse, is one of the most
elaborate and interesting in his admirable volume. It is sometimes
said that all reasoning is analytical, not synthetical; the
reducing a foregone conclusion to the first principles on which it
rests, rather than the building upon those first principles the
materials wherewith to construct the conclusion. Of this portion
of Dr. Hort's labours the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dictum</span></em> is emphatically true. Cod. B
and its characteristic peculiarities are never out of the author's
mind, and those lines of thought are closely followed which
most readily lead up to the theory of that manuscript's practical
impeccability. We allege this statement in no disparaging
spirit, and it may be that Dr. Hort will not wholly disagree
with us. Not only is he duly sensible of the precariousness of
Intrinsic evidence, inasmuch as <span class="tei tei-q">“the uncertainty of the decision
in ordinary cases is shown by the great diversity of judgement
which is actually found to exist”</span> (Hort, p. 21), but he boldly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and no less boldly than truly, intimates that in such cases the
ultimate decision must rest with the individual critic: <span class="tei tei-q">“in almost
all texts variations occur where personal judgement inevitably
takes a large part in the final decision.... Different minds will be
impressed by different parts of the evidence as clearer than the
rest, and so virtually ruling the rest: here therefore personal
discernment would seem the surest ground for confidence”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 65). For the critic's confidence perhaps, not for that of
his reader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The process of grouping authorities, whether by considerations
of their geographical distribution or (more uncertainly) according
to their genealogy as inferred from internal considerations
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> pp. 49-65), occupies a large measure of Dr. Hort's attention.
The idea has not indeed originated with him, and its occasional
value will be frankly acknowledged in the ensuing pages, so that
on this head we need not further enlarge. In conclusion we
will say, that the more our Cambridge Professor's <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction”</span>
is studied the more it grows upon our esteem for fulness of
learning, for patience of research, for keenness of intellectual
power, and especially for a certain marvellous readiness in
accounting after some fashion for every new phenomenon which
occurs, however apparently adverse to the acceptance of his own
theory. With all our reverence for his genius, and gratitude for
much that we have learnt from him in the course of our studies,
we are compelled to repeat as emphatically as ever our strong
conviction that the hypothesis to whose proof he has devoted so
many laborious years, is destitute not only of historical
foundation, but of all probability resulting from the internal
goodness of the text which its adoption would force upon us<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This last assertion we will try to verify by subjoining a select
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
number of those many passages in the N. T. wherein the two
great codices א and B, one or both of them, are witnesses for
readings, nearly all of which, to the best of our judgement, are
corruptions of the sacred originals<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Those who devote themselves to the criticism of the text
of the New Testament have only of late come to understand the
full importance of attending closely to the mutual connexion
subsisting between their several materials of every description,
whether manuscripts, versions, or Fathers. The study of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grouping</span></em> has been recently and not untruly said to be the
foundation of all enduring criticism<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>. Now that theories about
the formal recensions of whole classes of these documents have
generally been given up as purely visionary, and the very word
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">families</span></em> has come into disrepute by reason of the exploded
fancies it recalls, we can discern not the less clearly that certain
groups of them have in common not only a general resemblance
in regard to the readings they exhibit, but characteristic
peculiarities attaching themselves to each group. Systematic
or wilful corruption of the sacred text, at least on a scale worth
taking into account, there would seem to have been almost
none; yet the tendency to licentious paraphrase and unwarranted
additions distinguished one set of our witnesses from the second
century downwards; a bias towards grammatical and critical
purism and needless omissions appertained to another; while
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a third was only too apt to soften what might seem harsh, to
smooth over difficulties, and to bring passages, especially of the
Synoptic Gospels, into unnatural harmony with each other. All
these changes appear to have been going on without notice
during the whole of the third and fourth centuries, and except
that the great name of Origen is associated (not always happily)
with one class of them, were rather the work of transcribers
than of scholars. Eusebius and Jerome, in their judgements
about Scripture texts, are more the echoes of Origen than
independent investigators.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, as a first approximation to the actual state of the
case, the several classes of changes which we have enumerated
admit of a certain rude geographical distribution, one of them
appertaining to Western Christendom and the earliest Fathers
of the African and Gallic Churches (including North Italy
under the latter appellation); a second to Egypt and its
neighbourhood; the third originally to Syria and Christian
Antioch, in later times to the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
We have here, no doubt, much to remind us of Griesbach and
his scheme of triple recensions, but with this broad distinction
between his conclusions and those of modern critics, that
whereas he regarded the existence of his families as a patent
fact, and grounded upon it precise and mechanical rules for the
arrangement of the text, we are now content to perceive no more
than unconscious tendencies, liable to be modified or diverted
by a thousand occult influences, of which in each single case it is
impossible to form an estimate beforehand. Even that marked
bias in the direction of adding to the record, which is the
reproach of Codex Bezae and some of its compeers, and renders
the text of the Acts as exhibited by DE, by the cursive 137, and
the margin of the Harkleian Syriac, as unlike that commonly read
as can well be imagined<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a>, is mixed up with a proneness to omissions
which we should look for rather from another class of documents
(e.g. the rejection of ψευδόμενοι Matt. v. 11), and which in the
latter part of St. Luke's Gospel almost suggests the idea of
representing an earlier edition than that now in ordinary use,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet proceeding from the Evangelist's own hand (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg018" class="tei tei-ref">18</a>)<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>.
Again, the process whereby the rough places are made plain and
abrupt constructions rounded, is abundantly exemplified in the
readings of the great uncial A, supported as it is by the mass of
later manuscripts (e.g. Mark i. 27; Acts xv. 17, 18; xx. 24);
yet in innumerable instances (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> <a href="#Chapter_X_Appendix" class="tei tei-ref">Appendix</a> to this chapter)
these self-same codices retain the genuine text of the sacred
writers which their more illustrious compeers have lost or
impaired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence it follows that in judging of the character of a various
reading proposed for our acceptance, we must carefully mark
whether it comes to us from many directions or from one. And
herein the native country of the several documents, even when
we can make sure of it, is only a precarious guide. If the
Ethiopic or the Armenian versions have really been corrected by
the Latin Vulgate, the geographical remoteness of their origin
must go for nothing where they agree with the latter version.
The relation in which Cod. L and the Bohairic version stand
to Cod. B is too close to allow them their full value as independent
witnesses unless when they are at variance with that
great uncial, wheresoever it may have been written: the same
might be said of the beautiful Latin fragment <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span> from Bobbio.
To whatever nations they belong, their resemblances are too
strong and perpetual not to compel us to withhold from them
a part of the consideration their concord would otherwise lay
claim to. The same is incontestably the case with the Curetonian
and margin of the Harkleian Syriac in connexion with Cod. D.
Wide as is the region which separates Syria from Gaul, there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must have been in very early times some remote communication
by which the stream of Eastern testimony or tradition, like
another Alpheus, rose up again with fresh strength to irrigate
the regions of the distant West. The Peshitto Syriac leans at
times in the same direction, although both in nation and character
it most assimilates to the same class as Cod. A.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With these, and it may be with some further reservations
which experience and study shall hereafter suggest, the principle
of grouping must be acknowledged to be a sound one, and
those lines of evidence to be least likely to lead us astray which
converge from the most varied quarters to the same point. It
is strange, but not more strange than needful, that we are compelled
in the cause of truth to make one stipulation more:
namely, that this rule be henceforth applied impartially in all
cases, as well when it will tell in favour of the Received text,
as when it shall help to set it aside. To assign a high value to
cursive manuscripts of the best description (such as 1, 33, 69,
157, Evst. 259, or 61 of the Acts), and to such uncials as LRΔ, or
even as א or C, whensoever they happen to agree with Cod. B,
and to treat their refined silver as though it had been suddenly
transmuted into dross when they come to contradict it, is a practice
too plainly unreasonable to admit of serious defence, and
can only lead to results which those who uphold it would be
the first to deplore<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>.

(1) That the true readings of the Greek New Testament cannot
safely be derived from any one set of authorities, whether
manuscripts, versions, or Fathers, but ought to be the result of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a patient comparison and careful estimate of the evidence supplied
by them all.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) That where there is a real agreement between all documents
containing the Gospels up to the sixth century, and in
other parts of the New Testament up to the ninth, the testimony
of later manuscripts and versions, though not to be rejected
unheard, must be regarded with great suspicion, and, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">unless

(3) That where the more ancient documents are at variance

those of approved merit, are of real importance, as being the
surviving representatives of other codices, very probably as
early, perhaps even earlier, than any now extant.

(4) That in weighing conflicting evidence we must assign
the highest value not to those readings which are attested by

bear the least likeness to each other in respect to genius and
general character.

Ver. 22. In the room of τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῆς τῆς Ἡρωδιάδος a serious
variation of אBDLΔ, 238, 473, 558 is admitted into the text by Westcott
and Hort, τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτοῦ (+ τῆς 238, 558) Ἡρῳδιάδος, thus bringing
St. Mark into direct contradiction with Josephus, who expressly states
that the wretched girl was named Salome, and was the daughter of
Herod Philip by Herodias, who did not leave her husband till after
Salome's birth (Josephus, Antiq., lib. xviii. ch. v. § 4). Add to this the
extreme improbability that even Herod the Tetrarch should have allowed
his own child to degrade herself in such wise as Salome did here, or that
she could not have carried her point with her father without resorting
to licentious allurements. We must therefore regard αὐτοῦ as certainly
false, while αὐτῆς strongly expresses the writer's feeling that even
Herodias could stoop so low, and being used emphatically has so much
offended a few that they omit it altogether. Such are 1, 118, 209, and

Luke iv. 44. The wonderful variation Ἰουδαίας is brought into the
text of Hort and Westcott, the true reading Γαλιλαίας being banished to
their margin. Their change is upheld by a strong phalanx indeed:
אNBCLQR, 1, 21, 71, Evst. 222, 259 and some twenty other cursives
(Evan. 503 and two Lectionaries read αὐτῶν instead of either), the
Bohairic and the text of the Harkleian: authorities enough to prove
anything not in itself impossible, as Ἰουδαίας is in this place. Not only
is Galilee the scene of the events recorded immediately before and after
the present verse, but the passage is manifestly parallel to Mark i. 39.
The three Synoptic Gospels are broadly distinguished from that of
St. John by their silence respecting the Lord's ministry in Judaea before
He went up to the last passover. Yet Alford <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in loco</span></span>, while admitting

Luke vi. 48. It is surprising how a gloss so frigid as διὰ τὸ καλῶς

Westcott and Hort, in the room of τεθελεμίωτο γὰρ ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν, chiefly,
it may be presumed, because the latter is the expression of St. Matthew
(ch. vii. 25). Yet such is the reading of אBLΞ, of the two best cursives
33, 157, of the Bohairic (with some variation in its copies), of the
margin of the Harkleian, and of Cyril of Alexandria. The Ethiopic
preserves both forms. As the present οἰκοδόμοῦντι early in the verse
involves a plain contradiction when compared with the perfect οἰκοδομῆσθαι

feeble authority of the third hand of B, of 33, and possibly of 157.

John ii. 3. The loose paraphrase of Cod. א in place of ὑστερήσαντος

the worst deformities of his favourite: it runs καὶ οἶνον οὐκ εἶχον ὅτι

this Gospel, and sometimes elsewhere, has a good deal in common with
the Western codices and Latin Fathers, and some of its glosses are
simply deplorable: e.g. καλοκαγαθίας for κακοπαθείας, James v. 10; συνομιλοῦντες
for συνοικοῦντες, 1 Pet. iii. 7; ἀποθανόντος for παθόντος, 1 Pet. iv. 1
after ch. ii. 21, where it does not stand alone, as here. Of a better
character is its bold supplement of ἐκκλησία before συνεκλεκτή in 1 Pet. v. 13,

the two Apostles returned from, not to, Jerusalem is too plain for
argument (ch. xi. 29, 30), yet εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ (which in its present order
surely cannot be joined with πληρώσαντες) is the reading of Westcott and
Hort's text (ἐξ and the fatal obelus [Glyph: dagger] being in their margin) after
אBHLP, 61, four of Matthaei's copies, Codd. 2, 4, 14, 24, 26, 34, 64, 78,
80, 95, 224, and perhaps twenty other cursives, but besides these only
the margin of the Harkleian, the Roman Ethiopic, the Polyglott Arabic,
some copies of the Slavonic and of Chrysostom, with Theophylact and
Erasmus' first two editions, who says in his notes <span class="tei tei-q">“ita legunt Graeci,”</span>
i.e. his Codd. 2, 4. A few which substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“Antioch”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“Jerusalem”</span>

so those which, reading ἐξ or ἀπό, add with the Complutensian εἰς
Ἀντιόχειαν (E, 7, 14**, 27, 29, 32, 42, 57, 69, 98 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">marg.</span></span>, 100, 105, 106,

Arabic): Cod. 76 has εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ. C is defective here,
and the only three remaining uncials are divided between ἐξ (A, 13, 27,
29, 69, 214, Apost. 54, Chrysostom sometimes) and ἀπό (DE, 15, 18, 36,
40, 68, 73, 76, 81, 93, 98, 100, 105, 106, 111, 113, 180, 183, 184,
a copy of Chrysostom, and the Vulgate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ab</span></span>). The two Egyptian, the
Peshitto, the Philoxenian text, the Armenian and Pell Platt's Ethiopic
have <span class="tei tei-q">“from,”</span> the only possible sense, in spite of אB. Tischendorf in
his N. T. Vaticanum 1867 alleges that in that codex <span class="tei tei-q">“litterae εισ ιερου
primâ ut videtur manu rescriptae. Videtur primum απο pro εισ scriptum
fuisse.”</span> But since he did not repeat the statement three years later
in his eighth edition, he may have come to feel doubtful about it.
Dr. Hort conjectures that the original order was τὴν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ
πληρώσαντες διακονίαν.

Acts xvii. 28. Here Westcott and Hort place ὑμᾶς in their text,
ἡμᾶς in the margin. For ἡμᾶς we find only B, 33, 68, 95, 96, 105, 137,
and rather wonder than otherwise that the itacism is not met with in
more cursives than six. The Bohairic has been cited in error on the
same side. It needs not a word to explain that the stress of St. Paul's
argument rests on ὑμᾶς. To the Athenians he quotes not the Hebrew
Scriptures, but the poets of whom they were proud. Compare
Luke xvi. 12, above.

In Matt. xi. 16 they follow Tischendorf and Tregelles in adopting ἑτέροις

itacism (for it can be nothing better) was admitted so early as to affect
many of the chief versions.

Acts xx. 30. Cod. B omits αὐτῶν after ὑμῶν, where it is much wanted,
apparently with no countenance except from Cod. 186, for this is just
a point in which versions (the Sahidic and both Ethiopic) can be little
trusted. The present is one of the countless examples of Cod. B's
inclination to abridge, which in the Old Testament is carried so far as
to eject from the text of the Septuagint words that are, and always must
have been, in the original Hebrew. Westcott and Hort include αὐτῶν
within brackets.

Acts xxv. 13. Agrippa and Bernice went to Caesarea to greet the
new governor (ἀσπασόμενοι), not surely after they had sent their greeting
before them (ἀσπασάμενοι), which, if it had been a fact, would not have
been worth mentioning. Yet, though the reading is so manifestly false,
the evidence for the aorist seems overwhelming (אABHLP, the Greek

Coptic and Ethiopic versions). The future is found possibly in C,
certainly in 61, 221, and the mass of cursives, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> and other versions, in
Chrysostom, and in one form of Theophylact's commentary. Here again
Dr. Hort suspects some kind of prior corruption (Notes, p. 100).

Enough of the weary and ungracious task of finding fault. The foregoing
list of errors patent in the most ancient codices might be largely
increased: two or three more will occur incidentally in Chapter <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>
(1 Cor. xiii. 3; Phil. ii. 1; 1 Pet. i. 23; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> also pp. <a href="#Pg254" class="tei tei-ref">254</a>, <a href="#Pg319" class="tei tei-ref">319</a>). Even
if the reader has not gone with me in every case, more than enough has
been alleged to prove to demonstration that the true and pure text of
the sacred writers is not to be looked for in א or B, in אB, or BD, or
BL, or any like combination of a select few authorities, but demands, in
every fresh case as it arises, the free and impartial use of every available
source of information. Yet after all, Cod. B is a document of such
value, that it grows by experience even upon those who may have been
a little prejudiced against it by reason of the excessive claims of its too
zealous friends<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>. Its best associate, in our judgement, is Cod. C, where
the testimony of that precious palimpsest can be had. BC together will
often carry us safe through difficulties of the most complicated character,
as for instance, through that vexatious passage John xiii. 25, 26. Compare
also Acts xxvi. 16. Yet even here it is necessary to commend with
reserve: BC stand almost alone in maintaining the ingenious but
improbable variation ἐκσῶσαι in Acts xxvii. 39 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Chap. <a href="#Chapter_XII" class="tei tei-ref">XII</a>), and the
frigid gloss κρίνοντι in 1 Pet. iv. 5: they unite with others in foisting on
St. Matthew's text its worst corruption, ch. xxvii. 49. In Gal. iii. 1, C
against AB contains the gloss τῇ ἀληθείᾳ μὴ πείθεσθαι. Again, since no fact
relating to these pursuits is more certain than the absolute independence
of the sources from which A and B are derived, it is manifest that their
occasional agreement is always of the greatest weight, and is little less
than conclusive in those portions of the N. T. where other evidence is
slender in amount or consideration, e.g. 1 Pet. i. 21 and v. 10 (with the
Vulgate); v. 11: also supported by those admirable cursives 27, 29, in
1 Pet. v. 14; 1 John iv. 3; 19; 2 John 3; 12. See also 1 John v. 18,

Grammatical Form Of The Dialect Of The Greek
Testament.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. It will not be expected of us to enter in this place upon
the wide subject of the origin, genius, and peculiarities,
whether in respect to grammar or orthography, of that dialect
of the Greek in which the N. T. was written, except so far as it
bears directly upon the criticism of the sacred volume. Questions,
however, are perpetually arising, when we come to examine
the oldest manuscripts of Scripture, which cannot be resolved
unless we bear in mind the leading particulars wherein the
diction of the Evangelists and Apostles differs not only from that
of pure classical models, but also of their own contemporaries
who composed in the Greek language, or used it as their ordinary
tongue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Greek style of the N. T., then, is the result of blending
two independent elements, the debased vernacular speech of the
age, and that strange modification of the Alexandrian dialect
which first appeared in the Septuagint version of the Old
Testament, and which, from their habitual use of that version,
had become familiar to the Jews in all nations under heaven;
and was the more readily adopted by those whose native language
was Aramaean, from its profuse employment of Hebrew
idioms and forms of expression. It is to this latter, the Greek of
the Septuagint, of the Apocalypse, and of the foreign Jews, that
the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hellenistic</span></span> (Acts vi. 1) strictly applies. St. Paul,
who was born in a pure Greek city (Juvenal, iii. 114-118);
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
perhaps even St. Luke, whose original writings<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> savour strongly
of Demosthenes and Polybius, cannot be said to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">affected</span></em> the
Hellenic, which they must have heard and spoken from their
cradles. Without denying that the Septuagint translation
and (by reason of their long sojourning in Palestine) even
Syriac phraseology would powerfully influence the style of
these inspired penmen, it is not chiefly from these sources that
their writings must be illustrated, but rather from the kind
of Greek current during their lifetime in Hellenic cities and
colonies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Hence may be seen the exceeding practical difficulty of
fixing the orthography, or even the grammatical forms, prevailing
in the Greek Testament, a difficulty arising not only from the
fluctuation of manuscript authorities, but even more from the
varying circumstances of the respective authors. To St. John,
for example, Greek must have been an alien tongue; the very
construction of his sentences and the subtil current of his
thoughts amidst all his simplicity of mere diction, render it
evident (even could we forget the style of his Apocalypse) that
he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em> in Aramaean: divergences from the common Greek
type might be looked for in him and in those Apostles whose
situation resembled his, which it is very unlikely would be
adopted by Paul of Tarsus. Bearing these facts always in mind
(for the style of the New Testament is too apt to be treated
as an uniform whole), we will proceed to discuss briefly, yet as
distinctly as may be, a few out of the many perplexities of this
description to which the study of the original codices at once
introduces us<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. One of the most striking of them regards what is called
ν ἐφελκυστικόν, the <span class="tei tei-q">“ν attached,”</span> which has been held to be an
arbitrary and secondary adjunct. This letter, however, which is
<span class="tei tei-q">“of more frequent occurrence at the end of words, is itself of
such a weak and fleeting consistency, that it often becomes
inaudible, and is omitted in writing”</span> (Donaldson, Greek Grammar,
p. 53, 2nd edit.). Hence, though, through the difficulty
of pronunciation, it became usual to neglect it before a consonant,
it always comprised <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a real portion of the word to which
it was annexed</span></em>, and the great Attic poets are full of verses
which cannot be scanned in its absence<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>: on the other hand, the
cases are just as frequent where its insertion before a consonant
would be fatal to the metre. In these instances the laws of
prosody infallibly point out the true reading, and lead us up to
a general rule, that the weak or moveable ν is more often dropped
before a consonant than otherwise. This conclusion is confirmed
by the evidence of surviving classical manuscripts, although but
few of them are older than the tenth century, and would naturally
be conformed, in such minute points, to the fashion of that period.
Codices of the Greek Testament, and of the Septuagint, however,
which date from the fourth century downwards, present to us
this remarkable phenomenon, that they exhibit the final ν before
a consonant full as often as they reject it, and, speaking generally,
the most ancient (e.g. Evan. אABCD)<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> are the most
constant in retaining it, though it is met with frequently in
many cursive copies, and occasionally in almost all<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a>. Hence
arises a difficulty, on the part of modern editors, in dealing with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this troublesome letter. Lachmann professes to follow the
balance of evidence (such evidence as he received) in each
separate case, and, while he usually inserted, sometimes omitted
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nu</span></span> where he had no cause for such inconsistency except the
purely accidental variation of his manuscripts; Tischendorf
admits it almost always (N. T., Proleg. p. liii, 7th edition),
Tregelles (I think), as also Westcott and Hort, invariably.
Whether it be employed or not, the practice should at any rate
be uniform, and it is hard to assign any reason for using it
which would not apply to classical writers, whose manuscripts
would no doubt contain it as often as those of the N. T., were
they as remote in date<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a>. The same facts are true, and the same
remarks equally apply to the representing or withdrawing of the
weak ς in οὕτως before a consonant. Each of the aforenamed
editors, however, for the sake of euphony, prefers οὕτω before
σ at the beginning of the next word, except that Tregelles
ventures on οὕτως σε δεῖ in Acts xxiii. 11. Cod. א has οὕτω
about fourteen times in the N. T.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. In the mode of spelling proper names of places and persons
peculiar to Judaea, the general practice of some older
codices is to represent harsher forms than those met with in
later documents. Thus in Mark i. 21 καφαρναούμ is found in
אBDΔ, 33, 69, Origen (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>), the Latin, Bohairic, and Gothic
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but not the Syriac</span></em>: ܒܦܪܢܝܘܡ or ܡܘܝܢܪܦܒ) versions, and, from the facility
of its becoming softened by copyists, this may be preferred to
καπερναούμ of AC and the great numerical majority: yet we see
LP with C in Matt. iv. 13, where Z sides with BD. In other
instances the practice varies, even in the same manuscript, or in
different parts of the N. T. Tischendorf, for example, decides
that we ought always to read ναζαρέθ in St. Matthew, ναζαρέτ in
St. John (N. T., Proleg. p. lv, note): yet the Peshitto in all twelve
places that the name occurs, and the Curetonian in the four
wherein it is extant (Matt. ii. 23; iv. 13; xxi. 11; Luke ii. 51),
have the aspirate (ܢܨܕܐ or ܐܕܨܢ), and being written in a kindred dialect,
claim all the more consideration. Everywhere the manuscripts
vary considerably: thus in Mark i. 9 ναζαρέτ is found in אBLΓΔ,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Tregelles states), the Old Latin <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>, the Vulgate, the Bohairic and
Gothic as well as the elder Syriac. In Matt. iv. 13 Cod. B has
Ναζαρά by the first hand (but -έτ ch. ii. 23), Cod. א by a later one,
with Z, 33 (so Ξ in Luke iv. 16); CPΔ Ναζαράθ, which is found
in Δ nine times, in A twice: so that regarding the orthography
of this word (which is inconstant also in the Received text), no
reasonable certainty is to be attained. For Μαθθαῖος, again (the
variation from the common form Ματθαῖος adopted by Lachmann,
Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort), the authority is but
slender, nor is the internal probability great. Codd. אBΔ read
Μαθθαῖος in the title and headings to the first Gospel, while, in
the five places where it occurs in the text, B (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>), the
fragment T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">e</span></span>, and D have it always, א three times (but μαθθεος
Matt. x. 3, ματθαιον Mark iii. 18 with Σ in the subscription to the
first Gospel), the Sahidic and Gothic each twice: the Peshitto
and title of the Curetonian too (all that is extant) have ܡܬܚ (or ܚܬܡ).
For Ἰωάνης the proof is yet weaker, for here Cod. B alone, and
not quite consistently (e.g. Luke i. 13; 60; 63; Acts iii. 4, &amp;c.),
reads Ιωανης, Cod. א Ιωαννης<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a>, while Cod. D fluctuates between
the two. In questions of orthography Westcott and Hort, as
also the other editors in some degree, adopt a uniform mode of
spelling, without reference to the state of the evidence in each
particular case.

6. Far more important than these are such variations in
orthography as bear upon the dialect of the N. T. Its affinity
to the Septuagint is admitted on all hands, the degree of that
affinity must depend on the influence we grant to certain very
old manuscripts of the N. T., which abound in Alexandrian
forms for the most part absent in the great mass of codices.
Such are the verbal terminations -αμεν, -ατε, -αν in the plural of
the second aorist indicative, -οσαν for -ον in the plural imperfect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or second aorist, -ουσαν for -ουν, -αν for -ασι of the perfect, -άτω
for -έτω, -ατο for -ετο, -άμενος for -όμενος. In nouns the principal
changes are -αν for -α in the accusative of the third declension,
and (more rarely) the converse α for -αν in the first<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>. We have
conceded to these forms the name of Alexandrian, because it is
probable that they actually derived their origin from that city<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a>,
whose dialectic peculiarities the Septuagint had propagated
among all Jews that spoke Greek; although some of them, if not
the greater part, have been clearly traced to other regions; as
for example -αν for -ασι to Western Asia Minor also and to Cilicia
(Scholz, Commentatio, p. 9, notes w, x), occurring too in the
Pseudo-Homeric <span class="tei tei-q">“Batrachomyomachia”</span> (ἐπεὶ κακὰ πολλά μ᾽ ἔοργαν,
ver. 179). Now when we come to examine our manuscripts
closely we find the forms we have enumerated not quite banished
from the most recent, but appearing far more frequently in such
copies as אABC (especially D) LZ than in those of lower date.
It has been usual to ascribe such anomalous (or, at all events,
unclassical) inflexions to the circumstance that the first-rate
codices were written in Egypt; but an assumption which might
be plausible in the case of two or three is improbable as regards
them all; it will not apply at all to those Greek-Latin manuscripts
which must have been made in the West, or to the cursives in
which such forms are sparsely met with, but which were certainly
not copied from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">surviving</span></em> uncials<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>. Thus we are led to the
conclusion that the older documents retained these irregularities,
because they were found in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> prototypes, the copies first
taken from the sacred originals: that some of them were in all
likelihood the production of the skilful scribes of Alexandria,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though their exhibiting these forms does not prove the fact, or
even render it very probable: and that the sacred penmen, some
perhaps more than others, but all to some extent, were influenced
by their recollections and habitual use of the Septuagint version.
Our practical inference from the whole discussion will be, not
that Alexandrian inflexions should be invariably or even usually
received into the text, as some recent editors have been inclined
to do, but that they should be judged separately in every case on
their merits and the support adduced in their behalf; and be
held entitled to no other indulgence than that a lower degree of
evidence will suffice for them than when the sense is affected,
inasmuch as idiosyncrasies in spelling are of all others the most
liable to be gradually and progressively modernized even by
faithful and painstaking transcribers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The same remarks will obviously apply to those other
dialectic forms, which, having been once peculiar to some one
race of the great Greek family, had in the Apostles' time spread
themselves throughout the Greek colonies of Asia and Africa,
and become incorporated into the common speech, if they did
not enter into the cultivated literary style, of the whole nation.
Such are the reputed Dorisms ὀδυνᾶσαι Luke xvi. 25, καυχᾶσαι
Rom. ii. 17, 1 Cor. iv. 7 of the Received text, with no real variation
in any known manuscript: all such examples must stand or
fall on their own proper grounds of external evidence, the internal,
so far as it ought to go, being clearly in their favour. Like to
them are the Ionisms μαχαίρης Luke xxi. 24 (B*Δ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>); Heb.
xi. 34 (אAD*); 37 (אD*): μαχαίρῃ Luke xxii. 49 (אB<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">*</span></span>DLT
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>); Acts xii. 2 (אAB*D**, 61): συνειδυίης Acts v. 2 (AB<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></span>E
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>, συνιδυης א, συνιδυιης B*): σπείρης Acts xxvii. 1 of the
common text, where the only authorities for the more familiar
σπείρας seem to be Chrysostom, the cursives 37, 39, 56, 66, 100,
111, 183, 186, 188, 189. To this class belong such changes of
conjugation as κατεγέλουν Mark v. 40 in K, 228, 447, 511 or
c<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">scr</span></span>; or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>, as ἀγανακτῶντες Cod. 69, in Mark xiv. 4. The
form ἔστηκεν for ἕστηκεν John viii. 44; Apoc. xii. 4, adopted by
Westcott and Hort as the imperfect of στήκω (Mark xi. 25, &amp;c.),
does not seem suitable to the context in either place, although
οὐκ precedes in the former passage in אB*DLXΔΛ*, 1, 69*, 253,
507, 508, Evst. 234.

8. One caution seems called for in this matter, at least if we
may judge from the practice of certain critics of high and merited
fame. The sacred penmen may have adopted orthographical
forms from the dialect of the Septuagint, or from the debased
diction of common life, but they did not, and could not, write
what was merely inaccurate or barbarous. Hence repudiate, in
St. Paul especially, expressions like Tischendorf's ἐφ᾽ ἐλπίδι Rom.
viii. 20, as simply incredible on any evidence<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a>. He may allege
for it Codd. אB*D*FG, of which the last three are bilingual

only enables us to accumulate one example the more of the
fallibility of the very best documents, and to put in all seriousness
the inquiry of Cobet in some like instance: <span class="tei tei-q">“Quot annorum

way we utterly disregard the manuscripts when they confound

The reader has, we trust, been furnished with the leading
principles on which it is conceived that dialectic peculiarities
should be treated in revising the text of the N. T. It would
have been out of place to have entered into a more detailed
account of variations which will readily be met with (and must
be carefully studied) in any good Grammar of the Greek New
Testament. Dr. Moulton's translation of Winer ought to be in

by pertinent examples the canons of internal evidence

Tregelles into Τοῦ δὲ Χριστοῦ, Ἰησοῦ being omitted: Westcott

Ἰησοῦ of Cod. B in the margin: Tischendorf, who had rejected
Ἰησοῦ in his fifth and seventh editions, restored it in his eighth.
Michaelis had objected to the term τὸν Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, Acts viii.
37 (see that verse, to be examined below), on the ground that
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the time of the Apostles the word Christ was never used as

precise form ὁ Ἰησοῦς Χριστός occurs only in these places and in
1 John iv. 3; Apoc. xii. 17, where again the reading is more than
doubtful. Hence, apparently, the determination to change the
common text in St. Matthew, on evidence however slight. Now

version of Cod. D (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) indeed rejects it, the parallel Greek being
lost; but since <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span> sometimes agrees with other Latin copies

Latin, but on very precarious grounds, as Tregelles (An Account

absence from the Latin avowedly caused the editors of the
Complutensian N. T. to pass it over, though it was found in
their Greek copies: the earliest Latin Fathers naturally did
not cite what the Latin codices for the most part do not
contain. Among the Greeks it is met with in Isidore of Pelusium
(412), and in the Pseudo-Apostolic Constitutions, probably
of the fourth century: soon afterwards Chrysostom (Hom. in
Matt. xix. vol. i. p. 283, Field) comments upon it without showing
the least consciousness that its authenticity was disputed.
The silence of some writers, viz. Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen,
Augustine, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Maximus, especially when
expounding the Lord's Prayer, may be partly accounted for by
the fact of the existence of the shorter form of the Lord's Prayer
as given in St. Luke without the doxology; or upon the supposition
that the doxology was regarded not so much a portion
of the Prayer itself, as a hymn of praise annexed to it; yet this
latter fact would be somewhat unfavourable to its genuineness,
and would be fatal unless we knew the precariousness of any
argument derived from such silence. The Fathers are constantly
overlooking the most obvious citations from Scripture, even where
we should expect them most, although, as we learn from other
passages in their writings, they were perfectly familiar with
them. Internal evidence is not unevenly balanced. It is probable
that the doxology was interpolated from the Liturgies, and
the variation of reading renders this all the more likely; it is
just as probable that it was cast out of St. Matthew's Gospel to
bring it into harmony with St. Luke's (xi. 4): I cannot concede
to Scholz that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“in interruption of the context,”</span> for then the
whole of ver. 13 would have to be cancelled (a remedy which no

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Matt.</span></span> xi. 19. The change of τέκνων of the Received text
into ἔργων, as made by Tischendorf, Tregelles (who retains τέκνων
in his margin), by Hort and Westcott, is quite destructive to the
sense, so far as we can perceive, for Jerome's exposition (<span class="tei tei-q">“Sapientia
quippe non quaerit vocis testimonium, sed operum”</span>) could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hardly satisfy any one but himself. The reading ἔργων is supported
by אB* (with τέκνων in the margin by the hand B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>), 124,
the Peshitto Syriac (apparently; for all the older editions we
know punctuate ܠܒܕܘ (or ܘܕܒܠ) <span class="tei tei-q">“doers,”</span> not
ܠܒܕܘ (or ܘܕܒܠ) <span class="tei tei-q">“works”</span>), the Harkleian
text (but not its margin), the Bohairic, some copies known
to Jerome, Armenian manuscripts, the Ethiopic (one MS. contains
both forms), and (after the Peshitto Syriac) the Persic
of the Polyglott and its codices. We can hardly question
that the origin of the variation arose from the difficulty on the
part of translators and copyists to understand the Hellenistic
use of τέκνων in this place, and modern editors have been
tempted to accept it from a false suspicion that the present
passage has been assimilated to Luke vii. 35, where indeed Cod.
א and St. Ambrose have ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων ἀυτῆς. As we
have alleged that Jerome's explanation is unsatisfactory in St.
Matthew's Gospel, we subjoin that of Ambrose, which is certainly
no less obscure, on the parallel place of St. Luke: <span class="tei tei-q">“Bene <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ab
omnibus</span></em> quia circa omnes justitia servatur, ut susceptio fiat
fidelium, rejectio perfidorum. Unde plerique Graeci sic habent:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justificata est sapientia ab omnibus operibus suis</span></em>, quod opus
justitiae sit, circa uniuscujusque meritum servare mensuram.”</span>
In the face of the language of these two great Latin Fathers
it is remarkable that all other Latin authorities agree with
the Curetonian Syriac and the mass of Greek manuscripts in
upholding τέκνων, which is undoubtedly the only true reading.

to the end of ver. 3 is set within brackets by Tischendorf in his
eighth edition, within double brackets by Westcott and Hort,
who holds (Notes, p. 13) that <span class="tei tei-q">“both documentary evidence and
the impossibility of accounting for omission prove these words
to be no part of the text of Mt.”</span> Yet it might seem impossible
for any one possessed of the slightest tincture of critical instinct
to read them thoughtfully without feeling assured that they were
actually spoken by the Lord on the occasion related in the
Received text, and were omitted by copyists whose climate the
natural phenomena described did not very well suit, the rather
as they do not occur in the parallel text, ch. xii. 38, 39. Under
these circumstances, the internal evidence in favour of the passage
being thus clear and irresistible, the witnesses against it are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more likely to damage their own authority than to impair our

511, 575. Cod. 482 has the words, but only in a later hand at
the foot of the page (Nicholson). Of these cursive codices 157
alone is of the first class for importance, and the verses are
explained in the scholia of X (for ver. 3) and of 39. E and 606
have them with an asterisk; but they are wanting in the
Curetonian Syriac, the Bohairic according to Mill (but not so
other Coptic manuscripts and editions), and the Armenian, as
unaltered from the Latin. Origen passes them over in his
commentary, and Jerome, in his sweeping way, declares <span class="tei tei-q">“hoc
in plerisque codicibus non habetur.”</span> They are recognized in
the Eusebian canons (Tregelles, An Account of the Printed Text,
p. 205).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The united testimony of אB and the Curetonian version suffices
to show that the omission was current as early as the second
century, while the accordance of CD, of all the Latins and the
Peshitto, with the mass of later codices assures us that the words
were extant at the same early date. If any one shall deem this
a case best explained by the existence of two separate recensions
of the same work, one containing the disputed sentences, the other
derived from copies in which they had not yet been inserted, he
may find much encouragement for his conjecture by considering
certain passages in the latter part of St. Luke's Gospel, where the
same sort of omissions, supported by a class of authorities quite
different from those we have to deal with here, occur too often
to be merely accidental.

in the parallel places Mark x. 18, Luke xviii. 19 with no variation
worth speaking of; a fact which (so far as it goes) certainly lends
some support to the supposition that St. Matthew's autograph
contained the other reading [?]. Add to this that any change
made from St. Matthew, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supposing the common reading to be

therefore, would be a little in favour of the alteration approved
by Lachmann, Tischendorf, and the rest; and in discussing
external authority, their opponents are much hampered by the
accident that A is defective in this place, while א has recently
been added to the list of its supporters [though more recently
Φ and Σ have come into the opposite balance]. Under these
circumstances we might have been excused from noticing this
passage at all, as we are no longer able to uphold the Received
text with the same confidence as before, but that it seemed dishonest
to suppress a case on which Tregelles (An Account of the
Printed Text, pp. 133-8) has laid great stress, and which, when
the drift of the internal evidence is duly allowed for, tells more
in his favour than any other he has alleged, or is likely to be

Tregelles presses us hard with the testimony of Origen in
favour of the reading he adopts: ὁ μὲν οὖν Ματθαῖος, ὡς περὶ
ἀγαθοῦ ἔργου ἐρωτηθέντος τοῦ σωτῆρος ἐν τῷ, Τί ἀγαθὸν ποιήσω?
ἀνέγραψεν. Ὁ δὲ Μάρκος καὶ Λουκᾶς φασὶ τὸν σωτῆρα εἰρηκέναι, Τί
με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθός, εἰ μὴ εἷς, ὁ Θεός (Tom. iii. p. 644 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>).
<span class="tei tei-q">“The reading which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opposed</span></em> to the common text,”</span> Tregelles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“has the express testimony of Origen in its favour”</span>
(p. 134); <span class="tei tei-q">“might I not well ask for some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em> that the other
reading existed, in the time of Origen, in copies of St. Matthew's
Gospel?”</span> (p. 137). I may say in answer, that the testimony of
Origen applies indeed to the former part of the variation which
Tregelles maintains (τί με ἐρωτᾷς περὶ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ), but not at all
to the latter (εἷς ἐστιν ὁ αγαθός), and that the Peshitto Syriac
version of the second, as also the Sahidic of the third century,
uphold the common text, without any variation in the manuscripts
of the former, that we know of. Or if he asks for the evidence
of Fathers to counterbalance that of a Father, we have Justin
Martyr: προσελθόντος αὐτῷ τινὸς καὶ εἰπόντος (words which show,
as Tischendorf observes, that St. Matthew's is the only Gospel
that can be referred to) Διδάσκαλε ἀγαθέ, ἀπεκρίνατο λέγων, Οὐδεὶς
ἀγαθὸς εἰ μὴ μόνος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ποιήσας τὰ πάντα, citing loosely, as is
usual with him, but not ambiguously. Or if half the variation
will satisfy, as it was made to do for Origen, Tregelles' own note
refers us to Irenaeus 92 for τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? εἷς ἐστὶν ἀγαθός,
and to Eusebius for the other half in the form above quoted from
the Ethiopic, &amp;c. Moreover, since he cites the last five words of
the subjoined extract <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as belonging to St. Matthew</span></em>, Tregelles entitles
us to employ for our purpose the whole passage, Marcos. apud
Iren. 92, which we might not otherwise have ventured to do; καὶ
τῷ εἰπόντι αὐτῷ Διδάσκαλε ἀγαθέ, τὸν ἀληθῶς ἀγαθὸν θεὸν ὡμολογηκέναι,
εἰπόντα Τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? εἷς ἐστιν ἀγαθός, ὁ πατὴρ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς.
Jerome and Augustine (for the first clause only, though very
expressly: de Consensu Evan. ii. 63) are with the Latin Vulgate,
Hilary with the common Greek text, as are also Optatus,
Ambrose, Chrysostom, and the main body of later Fathers. Thus
the great mass of manuscripts, headed by C [followed by Φ and
Σ], is well supported by versions, and even better by ecclesiastical
writers; yet, in virtue of the weight of internal evidence [?], we
dare not hold out unreservedly against the reading of BDL, &amp;c.,
now that Cod. א is found to agree with them, even though
subsequent investigations have brought to light so close a relation
between א and B as to render it impossible, in our opinion, to

this verse in some very ancient documents has been given above
(I. 8), in the form represented in the Curetonian Syriac version.
It bears the internal marks of evident spuriousness, the first
sentence consisting of a rhetorical antithesis as unsuitable as can
be imagined to the majestic simplicity of our Lord's usual tone,
while the sentiment of the rest is manifestly borrowed from
Luke xiv. 8-10, although there is little or no resemblance in the
words. The only extant Greek for the passage is in Codd. Φ and
D, of which D gives the fullest text, as follows: ὑμεις δε ζητειτε;
εκ μεικρου αυξησαι και εκ μειζονος ελαττον ειναι Εισερχομενοι δε και

Syriac, the margin of the Harkleian contains it in a shape much
like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>, noting that the paragraph is <span class="tei tei-q">“found in Greek copies in
this place, but in ancient copies only in St. Luke, κεφ. 53”</span> [ch.
xiv. 8, &amp;c.]: Cureton has also seen it in one manuscript of the
Peshitto (Brit. Mus. 14,456), but there too in the margin.
Marshall states that it is contained in four codices of the Anglo-Saxon
version, which proves its wide reception in the West.
Of the Fathers, Hilary recognizes it, as apparently do Juvencus
and Pope Leo the Great (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 440-461). It must have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rejected by Jerome, being entirely absent from the great mass of

codex, or version, or ecclesiastical writer, has any knowledge of
the passage: while the whole language of the Greek of Cod. D,
especially in such words as δειπνοκλήτωρ, ἐξέχοντας, ἥττων,
χρήσιμος, is so foreign to the style of St. Matthew's Gospel, that
it seems rather to have been rendered from the Latin<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>, although
in the midst of so much variation it is hard to say from what
copy. Cureton too testifies that the Syriac of the version named
from him must have been made quite independently of that in
the margins of the Harkleian and Peshitto.

No one has hitherto ventured to regard this paragraph as
genuine, however perplexing it may be to decide at what period
or even in what language it originated. The wide divergences
between the witnesses must always dismiss it from serious
consideration. Its chief critical use must be to show that the
united testimony of the Old Latin, of the Curetonian Syriac,
and of Cod. D, are quite insufficient in themselves to prove any
more than that the reading they exhibit is ancient: certainly as
ancient as the second century.

7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Matt.</span></span> xxi. 28-31. This passage, so transparently clear
in the common text, stands thus in the edition of Tregelles:
(28) Τί δὲ ὑμῖν δοκεῖ? ἄνθρωπος εἶχεν τέκνα δύο, καὶ προσελθὼν
τῷ πρώτῳ εἶπεν, Τέκνον, ὕπαγε σήμερον ἐργάζου ἐν τῷ ἀμπελῶνι.
(29) ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, Οὐ θέλω; ὕστερον δὲ μεταμεληθεὶς ἀπῆλθεν.
(30) προσελθὼν δὲ τῷ δευτέρῳ εἶπεν ὡσαύτως. ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν,
Ἐγώ, κύριε; καὶ οὐκ ἀπῆλθεν. (31) τίς ἐκ τῶν δύο ἐποίησεν τὸ θέλημα
τοῦ πατρός? λέγουσιν, Ὁ ὕστερος. The above is indeed a brilliant
exemplification of Bengel's Canon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Proclivi orationi praestat
ardua.”</span> Lachmann in 1842 had given the same reading, with
a few slight and unimportant exceptions. The question is proposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which of the two sons did their father's will; the reply is
ὁ ὕστερος, the one that promised and then failed! Lachmann in
1850 (N. T., vol. ii. Praef. p. 5) remarks that had he been sure
that πρῶτος (ver. 31) was the reading of Cod. C, he should have
honoured it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only word that makes sense</span></em>, with a place in his
margin: <span class="tei tei-q">“Nihilo minus,”</span> he naïvely adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“id quod nunc solum
edidi ... ὁ ὕστερος veri similius est altero, quod facile aliquis
correctori adscribat, illud non item;”</span> and we must fairly
confess that no copyist would have sought to introduce a plain
absurdity into so beautiful and simple a parable. <span class="tei tei-q">“Quid vero,”</span>
he goes on to plead, <span class="tei tei-q">“si id quod veri similius esse dixi ne intellegi
quidem potest?”</span> (a pertinent question certainly) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">corrigetur, si
modo necesse erit</span></span>:”</span> critical conjecture, as usual, is his panacea.
Conjecture, however, is justly held inadmissible by Tregelles,
whose mode of interpretation is a curiosity in its way. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
believe,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“that ὁ ὕστερος refers not to the order in
which the two sons have been mentioned, but to the previous
expression about the elder son, ὕστερον δὲ μεταμεληθεὶς ἀπῆλθεν,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">afterwards</span></em> he repented and went.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Which of the two did his
father's will! ὁ ὕστερος. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He who afterwards</span></em> [repented and
went]. This answers the charge that the reading of Lachmann
is void of sense”</span> (An Account of the Printed Text, p. 107).
I entertain sincere veneration for the character and services of
Dr. Tregelles, but it is only right to assert at once that what

instead of the plain answer <span class="tei tei-q">“the first,”</span> our Lord's adversaries
resorted to the harsh and equivocal reply <span class="tei tei-q">“he who afterwards,”</span>
they would not have said ὁ ὕστερος, but ὁ ὕστερον, or (the
better to point out their reference to ὕστερον in ver. 29) ὁ τὸ
ὕστερον.

Why then prefer nonsense, for the mere purpose of carrying
out Bengel's canon to the extremity? The passage, precisely as
it stands in Tregelles' N. T., <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is sanctioned by no critical authority
whatsoever</span></em>. Cod. B indeed has ὕστερος (which is here followed
by Westcott and Hort), Cod. 4 δεύτερος, Codd. 13, 69, 124, 346
(Abbott's four), and 238, 262, 556, 604, perhaps others, ἔσχατος,
one or other of which is in the Jerusalem Syriac and Bohairic,
the Ethiopic (two manuscripts), the Armenian and two chief
Arabic versions; but all these authorities (with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tol.</span></span> of the
Vulgate <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundâ manu</span></span>, as also Isidore, the Pseudo-Athanasius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and John Damascene), transpose the order of the two sons in
vv. 29, 30, so that the result produces just the same sense as in the
Received text. The suggestion that the clauses were transferred
in order to reconcile ὕστερος or ἔσχατος with the context may be
met by the counter-statement that ὕστερος was just as likely to
be substituted for πρῶτος to suit the inversion of the clauses.
Against such inversion (which we do not pretend to recommend,
though Westcott and Hort adopt it) Origen is an early witness,
so that Cod. B and its allies are no doubt wrong: yet as that
Father does not notice any difficulty in ver. 31, the necessary
inference ought to be that he read πρῶτος<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>. Hippolytus testifies
to ἔσχατος in ver. 31, but his evidence cannot be used, since he
gives no indication in what order he took the clauses in vv. 29,
30. The indefensible part of Tregelles' arrangement is that,
allowing the answers of the two sons to stand as in our common
Bibles, he receives ὕστερος in the room of πρῶτος on evidence
that really tells against him. The only true supporters of
his general view are Cod. D αισχατος (i.e. ἔσχατος), the Old

consequently absent from Widmanstadt's edition and the
Antwerp, Paris, and London Polyglotts. Tremellius first
turned the Greek words into Syriac and placed them in the
margin of his book, whence they were most unwisely admitted
into the text of several later editions (but not into Lee's),
without the slightest authority. They also appear in the text
of the Harkleian, but the marginal note states that 'this passage
from the prophet is not in two [<span class="tei tei-q">“three”</span> Codd. Assemani] Greek

Cod. B) is very apparent throughout the N. T.; a single example
being their united omission of ἰσχυρόν in Matt. xiv. 30 in company
with but one other authority, the great cursive Cod. 33. Hence
we do not hesitate to receive a variation supported by only
a few first-rate authorities, where internal evidence (Canon II,
p. <a href="#Pg248" class="tei tei-ref">248</a>) pleads so powerfully in its favour. Although the middle
voice is found elsewhere in the N. T., yet the active in this
precise sense may be supported by good examples, even when
used absolutely, as here: e.g. ἄλλος οἱ ἀπορέοντι ὑπεθήκατο Herod.

Another less considerable but interesting variation, occurring
just before, in chap. v. 36, παρακούσας <span class="tei tei-q">“overhearing”</span> instead of

the Latin <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>, which must have had the reading, though it is

course neutral. The Peshitto ܕܡܕܒܝܐ (or ܐܝܒܕܡܕ) (qui purgat) refers in
gender to the noun immediately preceding, and would require
καθαρίζοντα. Will any one undertake to say what is meant by
the last clause of the verse as it stands in the Authorized English
version, and as it must stand, so long as καθαρίζον is read? If,
on the other hand, we follow Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf,
Westcott and Hort, we must take the Lord's words to end with
ἐκπορεύεται, and regard καθαρίζων πάντα τὰ βρώματα as the Evangelist's
comment upon them: <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This he said</span></em>, to make all things
clean.”</span> Compare Acts x. 15. This, and none other, seems to have
been the meaning assigned to the passage by the Greek Fathers.
It is indeed most simply expressed by Chrysostom (Hom. II.
in Matt. p. 526 A): Ὁ δὲ Μάρκος φησίν, ὅτι καθαρίζων τὰ βρώματα,
ταῦτα ἔλεγεν, where Dr. Field's elaborate note should be consulted.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He rightly judges that Chrysostom was treading in the
steps of Origen: καὶ μάλιστα ἐπεὶ κατὰ τὸν Μάρκον ἔλεγε ταῦτα ὁ
Σωτήρ, καθαρίζων πάντα τὰ βρώματα. Hence Gregory Thaumaturgus
designates the Lord as ὁ σωτὴρ ὁ πάντα καθαρίζων τὰ βρώματα.
I know not how Tischendorf came to overlook the passage from
Chrysostom: Tregelles very seldom uses him. It is obvious
how well the elliptical form of the expression suits this Evangelist's
style, which is often singularly concise and abrupt, yet
never obscure.

the authenticity of this long and important passage, and

brilliant monograph, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel

established”</span> (Oxford and London, 1871), has thrown a stream of
light upon the controversy, nor does the joyous tone of his
book misbecome one who is conscious of having triumphantly
maintained a cause which is very precious to him. We may
fairly say that his conclusions have in no essential point been
shaken by the elaborate and very able counter-plea of Dr. Hort
(Notes, pp. 28-51). This whole paragraph is set apart by itself in
the critical editions of Tischendorf and Tregelles. Besides this,
it is placed within double brackets by Westcott and Hort, and
followed by the wretched supplement derived from Cod. L (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vide

consciousness on the scribe's part that something is left out,

such peculiarity attaches to Cod. א. The testimony of L, that
close companion of B, is very suggestive. Immediately after

p. <a href="#Pg161" class="tei tei-ref">161</a>, note) infers that the old Jerusalem copies must have
contained our twelve verses. Codd. 15, 22 conclude at ἐφοβοῦντο
γάρ, then add in red ink that in some copies the Evangelist ends
here, ἐν πολλοῖς δὲ καὶ ταῦτα φέρεται, affixing vers. 9-20. In Codd.
1, 205 (in its duplicate 206 also), 209 is the same notice, ἄλλοις
standing for πολλοῖς in 206, with the additional assertion that
Eusebius <span class="tei tei-q">“canonized”</span> no further than ver. 8, a statement which
is confirmed by the absence of the Ammonian and Eusebian
numerals beyond that verse in אALSU and at least eleven
cursives, with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am. fuld. ing.</span></span> of the Vulgate. It would be no
marvel if Eusebius, the author of this harmonizing system, had
consistently acted upon his own rash opinion respecting the
paragraph, an opinion which we shall have to notice presently,
and such action on his part would have added nothing to the
strength of the adverse case. But it does not seem that he really
did so. These numerals appear in most manuscripts, and in all
parts of them, with a good deal of variation which we can easily
account for. In the present instance they are annexed to ver. 9
and the rest of the passage in Codd. CEKVΠ, and (with some
changes) in GHMΓΔΛ and many others: in Cod. 566 the
concluding sections are there (σλδ ver. 11, σλε ver. 12, σλς
ver. 14) without the canons. In their respective margins the
annotated codices 12 (of Scholz), 24, 36, 37, 40, 41, 108, 129, 137,
138, 143, 181, 186, 195, 210, 221, 222, 237, 238, 255, 259, 299,

weighty testimony in favour of the passage: παρὰ πλείστοις ἀντιγράφοις
οὐ κεῖται (thus far also Cod. 119, adding only ταῦτα, ἀλλ᾽
ἐνταῦθα καταπαύει) ἐν τῷ παρόντι εὐαγγελίῳ, ὡς νόθα νομίσαντες αὐτὰ

is none other than an extract from Victor of Antioch's [v] commentary
on St. Mark, which they all annex in full to the sacred
text, and which is expressly assigned to that Father in Codd. 12,
37, 41. Yet these very twenty-four manuscripts have been cited
by critical editors as adverse to the authenticity of a paragraph
which their scribes never dreamt of calling into question, but
had simply copied Victor's decided judgement in its favour. His
appeal to the famous Palestine codices which had belonged
to Origen and Pamphilus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg055" class="tei tei-ref">55</a> and note), is found in
twenty-one of them, possibly these documents are akin to the

forming the third of the eleven εὐαγγέλια ἀναστάσιμα ἑωθινά, the

were they suspected as of even doubtful authenticity<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest objector to vers. 9-20 we know of was Eusebius
(Quaest. ad Marin.), who tells that they were not ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς
ἀντιγράφοις, but after ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ that τὰ ἑξῆς are found σπανίως
ἔν τισιν, yet not in τὰ ἀκριβῆ: language which Jerome <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em> echoes
and almost exaggerates by saying <span class="tei tei-q">“in raris fertur Evangeliis,
omnibus Graeciae libris paene hoc capitulum fine non habentibus.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
A second cause with Eusebius for rejecting them is μάλιστα
εἴπερ ἔχοιεν ἀντιλογίαν τῇ τῶν λοιπῶν εὐαγγελιστῶν μαρτυρίᾳ<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a>. The
language of Eusebius has been minutely examined by Dean
Burgon, who proves to demonstration that all the subsequent
evidence which has been alleged against the passage, whether of
Severus, or Hesychius, or any other writer down to Euthymius
Zigabenus in the twelfth century, is a mere echo of the doubts
and difficulties of Eusebius, if indeed he is not retailing to us
at second-hand one of the fanciful Biblical speculations of Origen.
Jerome's recklessness in statement has been already noticed
(Vol. II. p. <a href="#Pg269" class="tei tei-ref">269</a>); besides that, he is a witness on the other side,
both in his own quotations of the passage and in the Vulgate,
for how could he have inserted the verses there, if he had
judged them to be spurious?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the argument against these twelve verses
arising from their alleged difference in style from the rest of
the Gospel, I must say that the same process might be applied—and
has been applied—to prove that St. Paul was not the writer
of the Pastoral Epistles (to say nothing of that to the Hebrews),
St. John of the Apocalypse, Isaiah and Zechariah of portions of
those prophecies that bear their names. Every one used to
literary composition may detect, if he will, such minute variations
as have been made so much of in this case<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>, either in his
own writings, or in those of the authors he is most familiar with.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Persons who, like Eusebius, devoted themselves to the pious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
task of constructing harmonies of the Gospels, would soon perceive
the difficulty of adjusting the events recorded in vers. 9-20 to the
narratives of the other Evangelists. Alford regards this inconsistency
(more apparent than real, we believe) as <span class="tei tei-q">“a valuable
testimony to the antiquity of the fragment”</span> (N. T. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad loc.</span></span>):
we would go further, and claim for the harder reading the
benefit of any critical doubt as to its genuineness (Canon I.
Vol. II. p. <a href="#Pg247" class="tei tei-ref">247</a>). The difficulty was both felt and avowed by
Eusebius, and was recited after him by Severus of Antioch or
whoever wrote the scholion attributed to him. Whatever
Jerome and the rest may have done, these assigned the ἀντιλογία,
the ἐναντίωσις they thought they perceived, as a reason (not the
first, nor perhaps the chief, but still as a reason) for supposing
that the Gospel ended with ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ. Yet in the balance of
probabilities, can anything be more unlikely than that St. Mark
broke off so abruptly as this hypothesis would imply, while no
ancient writer has noticed or seemed conscious of any such
abruptness<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>? This fact has driven those who reject the concluding
verses to the strangest fancies;—namely, that, like
Thucydides, the Evangelist was cut off before his work was
completed, or even that the last leaf of the original Gospel was
torn away.

the authenticity of the paragraph resolves itself into the allegations
of Eusebius and the testimony of אB. Let us accord to these
the weight which is their due: but against their verdict we can

the earlier part of the second century<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a>; to nearly all the versions;
and to all extant manuscripts excepting two, of which one is
doubtful. So powerfully is it vouched for, that many of those
who are reluctant to recognize St. Mark as its author, are content
to regard it notwithstanding as an integral portion of the inspired
record originally delivered to the Church<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a>.

The blessed words are distributed, after the Hebrew fashion, into
a stanza consisting of three members. In the first and second
lines heaven and earth are contrasted; the third refers to both
those preceding, and alleges the efficient cause which has
brought God glory and earth peace. By the addition of a single
letter to the end of the last line, by merely reading εὐδοκίας for
εὐδοκία, the rhythmical arrangement is utterly marred<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>, and the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which no scholar has yet construed to his own mind<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a>. Yet
such is the conclusion of Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles,
Westcott and Hort, although Tregelles and the Cambridge
fellow-workers allow εὐδοκία a place in their margins. Of the
five great uncials C is unfortunately defective, but א*AB*D, and
no other Greek manuscript whatever, read εὐδοκίας: yet A is so
inconstant in this matter that in the primitive 14th or Morning
Hymn, a cento of Scripture texts, annexed to the Book of
Psalms, its reading is εὐδοκεία (Baber, Cod. Alex., p. 569), and
such was no doubt the form used in Divine service, as appears
from the great Zürich Psalter O<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">d</span></span>. The rest of the uncials
extant (א<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></span>EGHKLMPSUVΓΔΛΞ, &amp;c.), and all the cursives
follow the common text, which is upheld by the Bohairic, by the
three extant Syriac (the Peshitto most emphatically, the Jerusalem,
and the Harkleian both in the text and Greek margin), by
the Armenian and Ethiopic versions. The Vulgate, as is well
known, renders <span class="tei tei-q">“in hominibus bonae voluntatis,”</span> and thus did all
the forms of the Old Latin, and after it the Gothic. Hence it
follows, as a matter of course, that the Latin Fathers, such as
Hilary and Augustine, and the Latin interpreters of Irenaeus
(who seems really to have omitted ἐν, as do D and a few cursives)
and of the false Athanasius, adopted the reading of their own
Bibles. Origen also, in a passage not now extant in the Greek, is
made in Jerome's translation of it manifestly to choose the same
form. We can only say that in so doing he is the only Greek
who favours εὐδοκίας, and his own text has εὐδοκία in three
several places, though no special stress is laid by him upon it.
But here comes in the evidence of the Greek Fathers—their
virtually unanimous evidence—with an authority from which
there is, or ought to be, no appeal. Dean Burgon (The Revision
Revised, pp. 42-46) affords us a list of forty-seven, all speaking
in a manner too plain for doubt, most of them several times
over, twenty-two of them having flourished before the end of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fifth century, and who must have used codices at least as old and
pure as א or B. They are Irenaeus, of the second century; the
Apostolical Constitutions and Origen three times in the third;
Eusebius, Aphraates the Persian, Titus of Bostra, Didymus,
Gregory Nazianzen, Cyril of Jerusalem (who has been quoted in
error on the wrong side), Epiphanius, Gregory of Nyssa four
times, Ephraem Syrus, Philo of Carpasus, a nameless preacher
at Antioch, and Chrysostom (nine times over, interpreting also
εὐδοκία by καταλλαγή) in the fourth; Cyril of Alexandria on
fourteen occasions, Theodoret on four, Theodotus of Ancyra, the
Patriarch Proclus, Paulus of Emesa, the Eastern Bishops at
Ephesus in 431, and Basil of Seleucia in the fifth; Cosmas
Indicopleustes, Anastasius Sinaita, and Eulogius of Alexandria
in the sixth; Andreas of Crete in the seventh; with Cosmas of
Maiuma, John Damascene, and Germanus, Archbishop of Constantinople,
in the eighth<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a>. Such testimony, supported by
all later manuscripts, together with the Bohairic and Syriac
versions, cannot but overpower the transcriptional blunder of
some early scribe, who cannot, however, have lived later than the
second century.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To those with whom the evidence of אBD and of the Latins
united appears too mighty to resist, we would fain prefer one
request, that in their efforts to extract some tolerable sense out
of εὐδοκίας, they will not allow themselves to be driven to renderings
which the Greek language will not endure. To spoil
the metrical arrangement by forcing the second and third members
of the stanza into one, is in itself a sore injury to the
poetical symmetry of the passage, but from their point of view
it cannot be helped. When they shall come to translate, it will
be their endeavour to be faithful, if grammatical faithfulness be
possible in a case so desperate. <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace on earth for those that
will have it,”</span> as Dean Alford truly says, is untenable in Greek,
as well as in theology: <span class="tei tei-q">“among men of good pleasure”</span> is unintelligible
to most minds. Professor Milligan (Words of the New
Testament, p. 194) praises as an interesting form <span class="tei tei-q">“among men of
his good pleasure,”</span> which, not at all unnecessarily, he expounds
to signify <span class="tei tei-q">“among men whom He hath loved.”</span> Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“among
men in whom He is well pleased”</span> (compare chap. iii. 22) can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be arrived at only through some process which would make any
phrase bear almost any meaning the translator might like to put
upon it. The construction adopted by Origen as rendered by
Jerome, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pax enim quam non dat Dominus non est pax bonae
voluntatis</span></span>, εὐδοκίας being joined with εἰρήνη, is regarded by Dr.
Hort <span class="tei tei-q">“to deserve serious attention, if no better interpretation
were available”</span> and for the trajection he compares ch. xix. 38;
Heb. xii. 11 (Notes, p. 56). Dr. Westcott holds that since
<span class="tei tei-q">“ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκίας is undoubtedly a difficult phrase, and the
antithesis of γῆς and ἀνθρώποις agrees with Rom. viii. 22, εὐδοκία
claims a place in the margin”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>): no very great concession,
when the general state of the evidence is borne in mind<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a>.

approved, omitting δευτεροπρώτῳ by way of getting rid of
a difficulty, as do both of them in Mark xvi. 9-20, and א in
Matt. xxiii. 35. The very obscurity of the expression, which
does not occur in the parallel Gospels or elsewhere, attests
strongly to its genuineness, if there be any truth at all in canons

common reading only by a familiar itacism. As this verse
commences a Church lesson (that for the seventh day or Sabbath

Hort banish it to the margin, intimating (if I understand their
notation aright) that it seems to contain distinctive and fresh
matter, without deserving a place in the text even as well as
Ἰησοῦ in Matt. i. 18. On reviewing the whole mass of evidence,
internal and external, we submit the present as a clear instance
in which the two oldest copies conspire in a false or highly
improbable reading, and of a signal exemplification of the Canon,

speech of our Divine Master has shaken many a pulpit, and
sanctified many a life. We might be almost content to estimate
Cod. B's claim to paramount consideration as a primary authority
by the treatment this passage receives from the hand of its
scribe, at least if the judgement were to rest with those who are
willing to admit that a small minority, whereof B happens to
form one of the members, is not necessarily in the right. Westcott
and Hort in the margin of their published edition (1881)
reduce the whole sentence between Μάρθα ver. 41 and Μαρία
ver. 42 to the single word θορυβάζῃ, the truer reading in the
place of τυρβάζῃ: in their privately circulated issue dated ten
years earlier they had gone further, placing within double
brackets μεριμνᾷς καί and from περὶ πολλά downwards. They
could hardly do less on the principles they have adopted, while
yet they feel constrained to concede that, though not belonging
to the original Gospel, the excluded words do not, on the other
hand, read like the invention of a paraphrast. They do not
indeed: and it is when abstract theories such as modern critics
have devised are subjected to so violent a strain, that we can
best discern their intrinsic weakness, of which indeed these
editors have here shown their consciousness by a change of mind
not at all usual with them. For the grave omission indicated
above we have but one class of authorities, that of the D, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>

δέ ἐστι χρεία is not found in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span> also, and does not appear in
Clement. The succeeding γάρ or δέ is of course left out by all
these, and by 262, the Vulgate, Curetonian Syriac, Armenian,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Jerome. This testimony, almost purely Western, is confirmed
or weakened as the case may be, by the systematic omissions of
clauses towards the end of the Gospel in the same books, of
which we spoke in Chap. X (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg299" class="tei tei-ref">299</a>, note).

We confess that we had rather see this grand passage expunged
altogether from the pages of the Gospel than diluted after the
wretched fashion adopted by א and B: ὀλίγων δὲ χρεία ἐστιν ἢ
ἑνός; the first hand of א omitting χρεία in its usual blundering
way. This travestie of a speech which seems to have shocked
the timorous by its uncompromising exclusiveness, much as we
saw in the case of Matt. v. 22, is further supported (with some
variation in the order) by L, by the very ancient second hand of
C, by 1, 33, the Bohairic, Ethiopic, the margin of the Harkleian,
by Basil, Jerome, Cyril of Alexandria in the Syriac translation
of his commentary<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a>, and by Origen as cited in a catena: ὀλίγων
δὲ ἐστι χρεία is found in 38, the Jerusalem Syriac, and in the
Armenian (ὧδε being inserted before ἐστιν). This latter reading
is less incredible than that of אBL, notwithstanding the ingenuity
of Basil's comment, ὀλίγων μὲν δηλονότι τῶν πρὸς παρασκευήν, ἑνὸς
δὲ τοῦ σκοποῦ. In this instance, as in some others, the force of
internal evidence suffices to convince the unprejudiced reader
(it has almost convinced Drs. Westcott and Hort, who have no
note on the passage), that the Received text should here remain
unchanged, vouched for as it is by AC*EFGHKMPSUVΓΔΛΠ
(Χ and Ξ being defective), by every cursive except three, by the
Peshitto and Cureton's Syriac (the latter so often met with in
the company of D), by the Harkleian text, by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">1</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">q</span></span> of the
Old Latin, and by the Vulgate. Chrysostom, Augustine (twice),
John Damascene and one or two others complete the list: even
Basil so cites the passage once, so that his comment may not be
intended for anything more than a gloss. No nobler sermon
was ever preached on this fertile text than that of Augustine,
De verbis Domini, in Evan. Luc. xxvii. His Old Latin copies,
at any rate, contained the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Circa multa es occupata: porro

15. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luke</span></span> xxii. 17-20. This passage has been made the
subject of a most instructive discussion by Dean Blakesley<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a>
(d. 1885), whose notion respecting it deserves more consideration
than it would seem to have received, though it must no doubt be
ultimately set aside through the overpowering weight of hostile
authority. He is perplexed by two difficulties lying on the
surface, the fact that the Lord twice took a cup, before and after
the breaking of the bread; and the close resemblance borne by
vv. 19 and 20 to the parallel passage of St. Paul, 1 Cor. xi. 24,
25. The common mode of accounting for the latter phenomenon
seems very reasonable, namely, that the Evangelist, Paul's almost
constant companion in travel, copied into his Gospel the very
language of the Apostle, so far as it suited his design. In
speaking of the two cups St. Luke stands alone, and much trouble
has been taken to illustrate the use of the Paschal cup from
Maimonides [d. 1206] and other Jewish doctors, all too modern
to be implicitly depended on. Dean Alford indeed (N. T. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad loc.</span></span>)
hails <span class="tei tei-q">“this most important addition to our narrative,”</span> which
<span class="tei tei-q">“amounts, I believe, to a solemn declaration of the fulfilment of
the Passover rite, in both its usual divisions—the eating of the
lamb, and drinking the cup of thanksgiving.”</span> Thus regarded,
the old rite would be concluded and abrogated in vv. 17, 18;
the new rite instituted in vv. 19, 20. To Dean Blakesley all
this appears wholly unsatisfactory, and he resorts for help to our
critical authorities. He first gets rid of the words of ver. 19
after σῶμά μου, and of all ver. 20, and so far his course is
sanctioned by Westcott and Hort, who place the whole passage
within their double brackets, and pronounce it a perverse interpolation
from 1 Cor. xi. 24, 25. This much accomplished,
the cup is now mentioned but once, but with this awkward
peculiarity, that it precedes the bread in the order of taking
and blessing, which is a downright contradiction of St. Matthew
(xxvi. 26-29) and of St. Mark (xiv. 22-25), as well as of
St. Paul. Here Westcott and Hort refuse to be carried further,
and thus leave the remedy worse than the disease<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a>, if indeed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there be any disease to remedy. Dean Blakesley boldly places
Luke xxii. 19 (ending at σῶμά μου) before ver. 17, and his work
is done: the paragraph thus remodelled is self-consistent, but it
is robbed of everything which has hitherto made it a distinctive
narrative, supplementing as well as confirming those of the
other two Evangelists.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now for the last step in Dean Blakesley's process of emendation,
the transposition of ver. 19 before ver. 17, there is no other
authority save <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> of the Old Latin and Cureton's Syriac, the
last with this grave objection in his eyes, that it exhibits the
whole of ver. 19, including that τοῦτο ποιεῖτε εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν
which he would regard as specially belonging of right, and as
most suitable for, St. Paul's narrative (Praelectio, p. 16), although
Justin Martyr cites the expression with the prelude οἱ γὰρ
ἀπόστολοι ἐν τοῖς γενομένοις ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀπομνημονεύμασιν, ἂ καλεῖται,
εὐαγγέλια. The later portion of ver. 19 and the whole of ver. 20,
as included in the double brackets of Westcott and Hort, are
absent from Cod. D, and of the Latins from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ff</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span>, as is ver.
20 from the Curetonian Syriac also: authorities for the most
part the same as we had to deal with in our Chap. X. p. <a href="#Pg299" class="tei tei-ref">299</a>,
note. Another, and yet more violent remedy, to provide
against the double mention of the cup, is found in the utter
omission of vers. 17, 18 in Evst. 32 and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">editio princeps</span></span> of the
Peshitto Syriac, countenanced by many manuscripts of the same<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a>.
Thus both the chief Syriac translations found a difficulty here,
though they remedied it in different ways<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>.

The scheme of Dean Blakesley is put forth with rare ingenuity<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a>,
and maintained with a boldness which is best engendered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and nourished by closing the eyes to the strength of the adverse
case. We have carefully enumerated the authorities of every
kind which make for him, a slender roll indeed. When it is stated
that the Received text (with only slight and ordinary variations)
is upheld by Codd. אABCEFGHKLM (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hiant</span></span> PR) SUXVΓΔΛΠ,
by all cursives and versions, except those already accounted for,
it will be seen that his view of the passage can never pass
beyond the region of speculation, until the whole system of
Biblical Criticism is revolutionized by means of new discoveries
which it seems at present vain to look for.

which may have hung over the authenticity of these verses,
whose sacred words the devout reader of Scripture could so ill
spare, is completely dissipated by their being contained in Cod. א<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a>.

Eusebian numerals for vv. 43-4 (ι)<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">σπγ</span></span>, and thus shows that its

the verses are obelized, and are marked by asterisks in ESVΔΠ,
24, 36, 161, 166, 274, 408: these, however, may very well be, and
in some copies doubtless are, lesson-marks for the guidance of
such as read the divine service (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf. sequent.</span></span>). A scholion in Cod.

Evangelistaria and in their cognate Cod. 69* and its three
fellows, the two verses, omitted in this place, follow Matt. xxvi.
39, as a regular part of the lesson for the Thursday in Holy
Week: in the same place the margin of C (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tertiâ manu</span></span>) contains
the passage, C being defective in Luke xxii from ver. 19. In
Cod. 547 the two verses stand (in redder ink, with a scholion)
not only after Matt. xxvi. 39, but also in their proper place in
St. Luke<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a>. Thus too Cod. 346, and the margin of Cod. 13.
Codd. LQ place the Ammonian sections and the number of the
Eusebian canons differently from the rest (but this kind of
irregularity very often occurs in manuscripts), and the Philoxenian
margin in one of Adler's manuscripts (Assem. 2) states
that it is not found <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Evangeliis apud Alexandrinos</span></em>, proptereaque

however, in Codd. אDFGHKLMQUXΛ, 1, and all other known
cursives, without any marks of suspicion, in the Peshitto,
Curetonian (omitting ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ), Harkleian and Jerusalem

The effect of
this great preponderance is enhanced by the early and express
testimony of Fathers. Justin Martyr (Trypho, 103) cites ἱδρὼς

Lord ἵδρωσε θρόμβους αἵματος in the second century. In the
third, Hippolytus twice, Dionysius of Alexandria, and Pseudo-Tatian;
in the fourth, Arius, Eusebius, Athanasius, Ephraem
Syrus, Didymus, Gregory of Nazianzen, Epiphanius, Chrysostom,
Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita; in the fifth, Julian the heretic,
Theodore of Mopsuestia, Nestorius, Cyril of Alexandria, Paulus
of Emesa, Gennadius, Theodoret, Bishops at Ephesus in 431;

other hand, declares that the passage is not found <span class="tei tei-q">“in Graecis et
in Latinis codicibus compluribus”</span> (p. 1062 a, Benedictine edition,
1693), a statement which Jerome, who leans much on others in
such matters, repeats to the echo. Epiphanius, however, in
a passage we have before alluded to (p. 270, note), charges
<span class="tei tei-q">“the orthodox”</span> with removing ἔκλαυσε in ch. xix. 41, though
Irenaeus had used it against the Docetae, φοβήθέντες καὶ μὴ

Of all recent editors, before Westcott and Hort set them within
their double brackets, Lachmann alone had doubted the authenticity
of the verses, and enclosed them within brackets: but
for the accidental presence of the fragment Cod. Q his hard rule—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mathematica

have forced him to expunge them, unless indeed he judged
(which is probably true) that Cod. A makes as much in their
favour as against them. So far as the language of Epiphanius is
concerned, it does not appear that this passage was rejected by
the orthodox as repugnant to their notions of the Lord's Divine
character, and such may not have been at all the origin of the
variation. We have far more just cause for tracing the removal
of the paragraph from its proper place in St. Luke to the practice
of the Lectionaries, whose principal lessons (such as those of
the Holy Week would be) were certainly settled in the Greek
Church as early as the fourth century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> above, Vol. I. pp. 74-7,

Professor Milligan does not disturb these precious verses in
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Words of the New Testament:”</span> and Mr. Hammond concludes
that <span class="tei tei-q">“on the whole there is no reasonable doubt upon the
passage.”</span> Thus Canon Cook is surely justified in his strong
asseveration that <span class="tei tei-q">“supporting the whole passage we have an
array of authorities which, whether we regard their antiquity or
their character for sound judgement, veracity, and accuracy, are
scarcely paralleled on any occasion”</span> (Revised Version, p. 103).

upon the cross: the words from Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς down to ποιοῦσιν
are set within brackets by Lachmann, within double brackets by
Westcott and Hort. They are omitted by only BD*, 38, 435,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among the manuscripts: by E they are marked with an asterisk
(comp. Matt. xvi. 2, 3; ch. xxii. 43,44); of א Tischendorf speaks
more cautiously than in the case of ch. xxii. 43, 44, <span class="tei tei-q">“A [a reviser]
(ut videtur) uncos apposuit, sed rursus deleti sunt,”</span> and we saw
there how little cause there was for assigning the previous
omission to א<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span>. In D the clause is inserted, with the proper
(Ammonian) section (τκ or 320), in a hand which cannot be earlier
than the ninth century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Scrivener's Codex Bezae, facsimile
11, and Introd. p. xxvii). To this scanty list of authorities for
the omission we can only add <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> of the Old Latin, the Latin

the section to his tenth table or canon, as it has no parallel
in the other three Gospels. The passage is contained without

that acute and learned men should be able to set aside such a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">silva</span></span>
of witness of every kind, chiefly because D is considered especially
weighty in its omissions, and B has to be held up, in practice if
not in profession, as virtually almost impeccable. Vain indeed is
the apology, <span class="tei tei-q">“Few verses of the Gospels bear in themselves a surer
witness to the truth of what they record than this first of the
Words from the Cross; but it need not therefore have belonged

doubt that it comes from an extraneous source”</span> (Hort, Notes,

entails such consequences is hopelessly self-condemned.

some expressly (e.g. Clement of Alexandria, Didymus <span class="tei tei-q">“de

apparent reference (e.g. Gregory of Nyssa). The Egyptian
versions may have read either θεός or θεοῦ, more probably the
latter, as Prebendary Malan translates for the Bohairic<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a>, the

forth by Tregelles, who strenuously maintains θεός as the true
reading, and thinks it much that Arius, though <span class="tei tei-q">“opposed to the
dogma taught,”</span> upholds μονογενὴς θεός. It may be that the term
suits that heretic's system better than it does the Catholic doctrine:
it certainly does not confute it. For the received reading
υἱός we can allege AC (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tertiâ manu</span></span>) EFGHKMSUVXΔΛΠ (D
and the other uncials being defective), every cursive manuscript

the Curetonian, Harkleian, and Jerusalem Syriac, the Georgian
and Slavonic, the Armenian and Platt's Ethiopic, the Anglo-Saxon
and Arabic. The array of Fathers is less imposing, but
includes Athanasius (often), Chrysostom, and the Latin writers
down from Tertullian. Origen, Eusebius, and some others have
both readings. Cyril of Jerusalem quotes without υἱός or θεός,—ὃν

Tregelles, who seldom notices internal probabilities in his
critical notes, here pleads that an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον like μονογενὴς

ὁ μονογενὴς υἱός from John iii. 16; 18; i John iv. 9, and he would
therefore apply Bengel's Canon (I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. 247). Alford's remark,
however, is very sound: <span class="tei tei-q">“We should be introducing great harshness
into the sentence, and a new and [to us moderns] strange
term into Scripture, by adopting θεός: a consequence which
ought to have no weight whatever where authority is overpowering,
but may fairly be weighed where this is not so. The
<span class="tei tei-q">‘praestat procliviori ardua’</span> finds in this case a legitimate limit”</span>
(N. T., note on John i. 18). Every one indeed must feel θεός to
be untrue, even though for the sake of consistency he may be
forced to uphold it. Westcott and Hort set μονογενὴς θεός in
the text, but concede to ὁ μονογενὴς υἱός a place in their margin.

Those who will resort to <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient evidence exclusively”</span> for
the recension of the text may well be perplexed in dealing with
this passage. The oldest manuscripts, versions, and writers are
hopelessly divided, so that we can well understand how some
critics (not very unreasonably, perhaps, yet without a shadow
of authority worth notice) have come to suspect both θεός and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
υἱός to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accretions</span></em> or spurious additions to μονογενής. If the
principles advocated in Vol. II. Ch. X be true, the present is just
such a case as calls for the interposition of the more recent
uncial and cursive codices; and when we find that they all,
with the single exception of Cod. 33, defend the reading ὁ μονογενὴς
υἱός, we feel safe in concluding that for once Codd. אBC
and the Peshitto do not approach the autograph of St. John so
nearly as Cod. A, the Harkleian Syriac, and Old Latin versions<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a>.

account only the more certainly genuine, words ὁ ὢν ἐν τῷ

Milligan) in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Synopsis Evangelica,”</span> 1864, but afterwards

can be cited against the clause except one manuscript of the
Bohairic: it appears in every one else, including the Latin,
the four Syriac, the Ethiopic, the Georgian, and the Armenian.
There is really no Patristic evidence to set up against it, for it
amounts to nothing that the words are not found in the Armenian
versions of Ephraem's Exposition of Tatian's Harmony (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
Vol. I. p. 59, note 2); that Eusebius might have cited them twice
and did not; that Cyril of Alexandria, who alleges them once,
passed over them once; that Origen also (in the Latin translation)
neglected them once, inasmuch as he quotes them twice, once
very expressly. Hippolytus [220] is the prime witness in their
behalf, for he draws the theological inference from the passage
(ἀποσταλεὶς ἵνα δείξῃ αὐτὸν ἐπὶ γῆς ὄντα εἶναι καὶ ἐν οὐρανῷ), wherein
he is followed in two places by Hilary and by Epiphanius.

then have a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consensus</span></em> of versions and ecclesiastical writers from
every part of the Christian world, joining Cod. A and the later
manuscripts in convicting אBL, &amp;c., or the common sources from
which they were derived, of the deliberate suppression of one
of the most mysterious, yet one of the most glorious, glimpses
afforded to us in Scripture of the nature of the Saviour, on the
side of His Proper Divinity.

Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort, obelized (=) by
Griesbach, but retained by Scholz and Lachmann. The evidence
against it is certainly very considerable: Codd. אBC*D, 33, 157,
314, but D, 33 contain ἐκδεχομένων ... κίνησιν, which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> A*L,

A and L are much together against N, and against B yet more.
The words from ἄγγελος γάρ to νοσήματι are noted with asterisks
or obeli (employed without much discrimination) in SΛ, 8, 11?,

leaves out what the Harkleian margin obelizes, but the Peshitto
and Jerusalem Syriac, all Latin copies not aforenamed, Wilkins'
Bohairic, and Armenian editions are for retaining the disputed
words. Tertullian clearly recognizes them (<span class="tei tei-q">“piscinam Bethsaidam

The first clause (ἐκδεχ ... κίνησιν) can hardly stand in
Dr. Scrivener's opinion, in spite of the versions which support it,
as DI are the oldest manuscript witnesses in its favour, and it
bears much of the appearance of a gloss brought in from the
margin. The succeeding verse is harder to deal with<a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a>; but for
the countenance of the versions and the testimony of Tertullian,
Cod. A could never resist the joint authority of אBCD, illustrated
as they are by the marks of suspicion set in so many
later copies. Yet if ver. 4 be indeed but an <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insertion to complete
that implied in the narrative with reference to the popular belief</span></em>”</span>
(Alford, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad loc.</span></span>), it is much more in the manner of Cod. D and
the Curetonian Syriac, than of Cod. A and the Latin versions;
and since these last two are not very often found in unison, and
together with the Peshitto, opposed to the other primary documents,
it is not very rash to say that when such a conjunction
does occur, it proves that the reading was early, widely diffused,
and extensively received. Yet, after all, if the passage as it
stands in our common text can be maintained as genuine at all,
it must be, we apprehend, on the principle suggested above,
Vol. I. Chap. I. § 11, p. 18. The chief difficulty, of course, consists
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the fact that so many copies are still without the addition, if
assumed to be made by the Evangelist himself: nor will this
supposition very well account for the wide variations subsisting
between the manuscripts which do contain the supplement, both
here and in chh. vii. 53-viii. 11<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a>.

which Lachmann, Westcott and Hort, apparently with Professor
Milligan, join in approving, ἐγὼ οὔπω ἀναβαίνω εἰς τὴν ἑορτὴν

but rather a gentle intimation that what He would not do then,
He would do hereafter. It is plain therefore that Porphyry the
foe, and Jerome the defender of the faith, both found in their
copies οὐκ, not οὔπω, and this is the reading of Tischendorf and
Tregelles: Hort and Westcott set it in their margin. Thus too
Epiphanius and Chrysostom in the fourth century, Cyril in the
fifth, each of them feeling the difficulty of the passage, and

a goodly band, gathered from east and west alike. In this case
no hesitation would have been felt in adopting a reading, not
only the harder in itself, but the only one that will explain the

its Greek margin. Basil is alleged for the same reading, doubtless
not expressly, like the Fathers named above. It is seldom
that we can trace so clearly the date and origin of an important
corruption which could not be accidental, and it is well to know
that no extant authorities, however venerable, are quite exempt
from the influence of dishonest zeal.

be regarded as a portion of St. John's Gospel. It is absent from
too many excellent copies not to have been wanting in some of
the very earliest; while the arguments in its favour, internal
even more than external, are so powerful, that we can scarcely
be brought to think it an unauthorized appendage to the writings
of one, who in another of his inspired books deprecated so
solemnly the adding to or taking away from the blessed testimony
he was commissioned to bear (Apoc. xxii. 18, 19). If
ch. xx. 30, 31 show signs of having been the original end of this
Gospel, and ch. xxi be a later supplement by the Apostle's own
hand, which I think with Dean Alford is evidently the case,
why should not St. John have inserted in this second edition
both the amplification in ch. v. 3, 4, and this most edifying and
eminently Christian narrative? The appended chapter (xxi)
would thus be added at once to all copies of the Gospels then in
circulation, though a portion of them might well overlook the
minuter change in ch. v. 3, 4, or, from obvious though mistaken
motives, might hesitate to receive for general use or public
reading the history of the woman taken in adultery.

In Codd. 37, 102, 105, ch. viii. 3-11 alone is put at the end of
the Gospel, which is all that 259 supplies, though its omission in
the text begins at ch. vii. 53. Cod. 237, on the contrary, omits
only from ch. viii. 3, but at the end inserts the whole passage

between ch. vii. 52 and 53, and repeated again in its proper
place. Finally, Codd. 13, 69, 124, 346 (being Abbott's group),
and 556 give the whole passage at the end of Luke xxi, the
order being apparently suggested from comparing Luke xxi. 37

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the lesson for Pentecost (John vii. 37-viii. 12), but was
reserved for the festivals of such saints as Theodora Sept. 18,
or Pelagia Oct. 8 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Vol. I. p. 87, notes 2 and 3), as also in
Codd. 547, 604, and in many Service-books, whose Menology
was not very full (e.g. 150, 189, 257, 259), it would thus be
omitted altogether. Accordingly, in that remarkable Lectionary,
the Jerusalem Syriac, the lesson for Pentecost ends at ch. viii. 2,
the other verses (3-11) being assigned to St. Euphemia's day
(Sept. 16).

Of the other versions, the paragraph is entirely omitted in

the circumstances before stated under that version), in Cureton's
Syriac, and in the Harkleian; though it appears in the Codex
Barsalibaei, from which White appended it to the end of
St. John: a Syriac note in this copy states that it does not
belong to the Philoxenian, but was translated in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 622 by

Of the Fathers, Euthymius [xii], the first among the Greeks

manuscripts of good character, but quite inadequate to prove
the authenticity of the verse, even though they did not differ
considerably in the actual readings they exhibit, which is
always in itself a ground of reasonable suspicion (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> pp. <a href="#Pg361" class="tei tei-ref">361</a>,

of the Vulgate, the Armenian, Polyglott Arabic, and
Slavonic. Bede, however, who used Cod. E, knew <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em>
copies in which the verse was wanting: yet it was known to
Cyprian, Jerome, Augustine, Pacian, &amp;c. among the Latins, to
Œcumenius and Theophylact (twice quoted) among the Greeks.
Erasmus seems to have inserted the verse by a comparison of the
later hand of Cod. 4 with the Vulgate<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>; it is not in the Complutensian

an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">addition</span></em> well received in the Western Church from the
second century downwards (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg164" class="tei tei-ref">164</a>), and afterwards making

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
24. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Acts</span></span> xi. 20. We are here in a manner forced by the sense
to adopt, with Griesbach, Bp. Chr. Wordsworth, Lachmann,
Tischendorf, and Tregelles, the reading Ἕλληνας in the room of
Ἑλληνιστάς of the Received text, retained by Westcott and
Hort<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a>. Immediately after the call of the Gentiles to the
privileges of the Gospel was acknowledged and acquiesced in at
Jerusalem (ver. 18), we read that some of those who had been
scattered abroad years ago went about preaching the word to
Jews only (ver. 19). In this there was nothing new: there had
been Ἑλληνισταί <span class="tei tei-q">“Greek-speaking Jews”</span> among the brethren
long since (ch. vi. 1), and to say that they were again preached
to was not at all strange: the marvel is contained in ver. 20.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene,
which, when they came to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also”</span>
(καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἕλληνας: καί intimating the additional information),
and that with such success in converting these heathen Greeks,
that Gentile Christians first obtained at Antioch the name, no
longer of Nazarenes (ch. xxiv. 5), but of Christians (ver. 26).
The meaning being thus evident, we look to the authorities
which uphold it, and these are few, confessedly insufficient if the
sense left us any choice, but recommended to us, as the matter
stands, by their intrinsic excellence: they are AD* (the latter
without καί, which is, however, otherwise abundantly attested
to) Cod. 184, one of the best of the cursives, but not its kindred
221, the Peshitto Syriac, the Armenian, perhaps the Ethiopic.
The Vulgate, Bohairic, Sahidic, and Harkleian Syriac draw no
distinction between Ἕλληνες and Ἑλληνισταί: the Peshitto
unquestionably does, since it renders <span class="tei tei-q">“Greek disciples”</span> in ch. vi. 1,
<span class="tei tei-q">“those Jews who knew Greek”</span> (an excellent definition) in
ch. ix. 29, but <span class="tei tei-q">“Greeks”</span> here. Eusebius clearly reads Ἕλληνας,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as does Chrysostom in his exposition (not in his text), all the
more surely because he is perplexed how to expound it: his
words are echoed by Œcumenius and in both commentaries of
Theophylact, only that they substitute Ἑλληνιστάς for Ἕλληνας
in repeating his words διὰ τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι ἑβραïστί, Ἕλληνας
ἐκάλουν: they both have Ἑλληνιστάς in the text. Thus for once
B is associated with E, with a later hand of D (of the seventh or
eighth century), with the later uncials HLP and all cursives
except one, in maintaining a variation demonstrably false. C is
defective here, and the first hand of א, which presents us with
the wonderful εὐαγγελιστάς, makes so far in favour of B; but א<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>
corrects that error into Ἕλληνας.

25. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Acts</span></span> xiii. 18. We have here as nice a balance between
conflicting readings (differing only by a single letter) as we find
anywhere in the N. T. The case is stated in the margin to our
Authorized version of the Bible, more minutely than is its wont,
though modern printers have unwarrantably left out the reference
to 2 Macc. vii. 27 in copies not containing the Apocrypha<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a>. For
ἐτροποφόρησεν <span class="tei tei-q">“suffered he their manners”</span> of Tregelles, of
Westcott and Hort, are cited אB, the very ancient second hand
of C, D (in the Greek), HLP, 61 with almost all other cursives
and the catenas: for the alternative ἐτροφοφόρησεν <span class="tei tei-q">“fed them like
a nurse”</span> of Lachmann and Tischendorf (Tregelles placing it in
his margin) we find ACE, 13, 24* (not 24** with Tischendorf),
68, 78* (margin), 93, 100, 105, 142, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span> against its own Greek and
the Vulgate jointly. Versions are in such a case of special
weight, but unfortunately they too are somewhat divided.
For π we find the Vulgate and a Greek note set in the
Harkleian margin, for φ the Peshitto and Harkleian Syriac,
both Egyptian, the Armenian, and both Ethiopic, with
Erpenius' Arabic: the Arabic of the Polyglott gives both
renderings. Thus the majority of the versions incline one way,
the oldest and most numerous manuscripts the other. It is
useless to cite Greek writers, except they show from the context
which word they favour. The form with φ was doubtless read
in the Apostolic Constitutions, and twice in Cyril of Alexandria,
and that word is supported as well by 2 Macc. vii. 27, as by the
other text cited in the margin of the Authorized English Bible,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Deut. i. 31, to which the Apostle's reference is so manifest, that
we cannot but regard it as nearly decisive which expression he
used. Although in Deuteronomy also Greek copies vary a little
between π and φ, yet both A and B<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> read the latter, indeed the
Hebrew נשא, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pace Hortii</span></span>, would admit of nothing else. For
π Origen is express, both in his Greek commentary (not his text)
and Latin version, but then he seems to employ it even in Deut.
i. 31, where it cannot be correct. Chrysostom and Theophylact
give no certain sound. Wetstein seasonably illustrates ἐτροπ.
from Rom. ix. 22. Internal evidence certainly points to
ἐτροφοφόρησεν, which on the whole may be deemed preferable.
The Apostle is anxious to please his Jewish hearers by
enumerating the mercies their nation had received from the
Divine favour. God had chosen them, exalted them in Egypt,
brought them out with a high hand, fed them in the wilderness,
and given them the land of Promise. It would hardly have
suited his purpose to have interposed, by way of parenthesis, in
the midst of his detail of benefits received, the unwelcome
suggestion of their obstinate ingratitude and of God's long
forbearance.

is supported by the third hand of C, by EHLP, by all the
cursives, by the two Syriac and Armenian versions, the catenae,
Chrysostom and Theophylact. The Sahidic omits ἡμῖν, the
Bohairic both pronouns. To take up ἡμῖν without αὐτῶν, the
reading of a solitary cursive of the eleventh century, Cod. 76,
would approach the limits of mere conjecture, yet every one can
see how well it would account for all other variations. <span class="tei tei-q">“The

in England. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dei”</span> is read by all known manuscripts and
editions of the Vulgate except the Complutensian, which was
probably altered to suit the parallel Greek. From the Vulgate
this form was taken by Erasmus, and after him by Tyndale's and
later English versions. Lee's edition of the Peshitto has θεου,
from three codices (the Travancore, a Vatican Lectionary of Adler
[xi], and one at the Bodleian), and so has the Harkleian text.
Τοῦ κυρίου (differing but by one letter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> our Plates v. No. 13;
x. No. 25) is in AC*DE (and therefore in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>), 13, 15, 18, 36

some catenae, the Harkleian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">margin</span></em>, the Sahidic, Bohairic,
Armenian, and possibly also the Roman Ethiopic, though
there the same word is said to represent both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">θυ</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">κυ</span></span>. Platt's
Ethiopic, all editions of the Peshitto except Lee's, and Erpenius'
Arabic, have τοῦ χριστοῦ, with Origen once, Theodoret twice, and
four copies of Athanasius: the Old Latin <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span> reads 'Jesu Christi.'
Other variations, too weakly supported to be worth further
notice, are τοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ 3, 95**, the Polyglott Arabic; τοῦ θεοῦ
καὶ κυρίου 47; and the Georgian τοῦ κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ. The great
mass of later manuscripts give τοῦ κυρίου καὶ θεοῦ, viz. C (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tertiâ
manu</span></span>), HLP, 24, 31, 111, 183, 185, 187, 188, 189, 221, 224, and
more than one hundred other cursives, including probably every
one not particularized above. This is the reading of the Complutensian
editors, both in the Greek and Latin, and of some modern
critics who would fain take a safe and middle course; but is countenanced
by the reading of no version except the Slavonic, and
by no ecclesiastical writer before Theophylact. It is plainly
but a device for reconciling the two principal readings; yet from
the non-repetition of the article and from the general turn of
the sentence it asserts the Divinity of the Saviour almost as
unequivocally as θεοῦ could do alone. Our choice evidently lies
between κυρίου and θεοῦ, which are pretty equally supported by
manuscripts and versions: Patristic testimony, however, may
slightly incline to the latter. Foremost comes that bold expression
of Ignatius [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 107] ἀναζωπυρήσαντες ἐν αἵματι θεοῦ
(ad Ephes. i), which the old Latin version renders <span class="tei tei-q">“Christi Dei,”</span>
and the later interpolator softens into χριστοῦ: so again (ad
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Roman. vi), τοῦ πάθους τοῦ θεοῦ μου. It may be true that
Ignatius <span class="tei tei-q">“does not adopt it [the first passage] as a quotation”</span>
(Davidson <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad loc.</span></span>), yet nothing short of Scriptural authority
could have given such early vogue to a term so startling as αἷμα
θεοῦ, which is also employed by Tertullian (ad uxorem, ii. 3) and
Clement of Alexandria (Quis dives, 34). The elder Basil,
Epiphanius (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>), Cyril of Alexandria (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>), Ibas (in the
Greek only), Ambrose, Caelestine, Fulgentius, Primasius, Cassiodorus,
&amp;c., not to mention writers so recent as Œcumenius and
Theophylact, expressly support the same word. Manuscripts of
Athanasius vary between θεοῦ, κυρίου, and χριστοῦ, but his evidence
would be regarded as hostile to the Received text, inasmuch as
he states (as alleged by Wetstein) that οὐδαμοῦ δὲ αἷμα θεοῦ καθ᾽
ἡμᾶς παραδεδώκασιν αἱ γραφαί; Ἀρειανῶν τὰ τοιαῦτα τολμήματα (contra
Apollinar.): only that for καθ᾽ ἡμᾶς (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which even Tischendorf cites
in his seventh edition</span></em>), the correct reading is δίχα σαρκός or διὰ
σαρκός, a citation fatal to any such inference. In Chrysostom
too the readings fluctuate, and some (e.g. Tregelles) have
questioned whether the Homilies on the Acts, wherein he has
θεοῦ, are of his composition. In behalf of κυρίου are cited the
Latin version of Irenaeus, Lucifer of Cagliari, Augustine, Jerome,
Ammonius, Eusebius, Didymus, Chrysostom (whence Theophylact),
possibly Theodoret, and the Apostolic Constitutions, while
the exact expression <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sanguis Dei</span></span> was censured by Origen and
others. It has been urged, however, and not without some show
of reason (Nolan, Integrity of Greek Vulgate, p. 517, note 135),
that the course of Irenaeus' argument proves that θεοῦ was used
in his lost Greek text. After all, internal evidence—subjective
feeling if it must be so called—will decide the critic's choice
where authorities are so much divided as here. It seems
reasonable to say that the whole mass of witnesses for τοῦ κυρίου
καὶ θεοῦ vouches for the existence of θεοῦ in the earliest codices,
the commonplace κυρίου being the rather received from other
quarters, as it tends to point more distinctly to the Divine
Person indicated in the passage. If this view be accepted, the
preponderance in favour of θεοῦ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">undoubtedly the harder form</span></em>, is
very marked, and when the consideration suggested above from
Dean Alford is added, there will remain little room for hesitation.
It has been pleaded on both sides of the question, and appears
little relevant to the case of either, that St. Paul employs in ten
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
places the expression ἐκκλησία τοῦ θεοῦ, but never once ἐκκλησία
τοῦ κυρίου or τοῦ χριστοῦ.

It is right to mention that, in the place of τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος,

Nor can we do less than repudiate unreservedly Dr. Hort's
expedient (Notes, p. 99), who would render <span class="tei tei-q">“through the blood

known cursives (with a like variation in the termination as

text and in Greek letters in its margin, the Armenian, and
Erpenius', or the only trustworthy form of the Arabic.
Chrysostom and Bede have the same reading, which must surely
be retained unless the union of Cod. B with the Latins is to
prevail against all other evidence put together.

placing the common reading in the margin. Their form is
supported by Cod. B and the Sahidic version only, and was
plainly resorted to by those who were slow to believe that
a corn ship, presumably heavily laden (vers. 6, 18), would contain
so many souls. There is a slight variation in the other
authorities, as is usual where numbers are concerned, from the
ancient practice of representing them by letters, whereof many
traces are yet remaining throughout Codex Sarravianus of the
Septuagint, dating from the end of the fourth century, and in our
present copies (Cod. D in Acts xiii. 18; 20; xix. 9) of the New
Testament: even in this place Cod. 61 has σοϛ. Hence A reads
πέντε for ἕξ, 31 omits ἕξ entirely, one Bohairic copy has the
incredible number of 876 (ωοϛ), another 176 (ροϛ). The Ethiopic
is reported by Tregelles to read ὡς διακόσιαι ἕξ, but that in the
Polyglott favours the common text; Epiphanius comes nearest
to B (ὡς ἑβδομήκοντα), <span class="tei tei-q">“libere”</span> adds Tischendorf. For the more

In ordinary cases the common reading would be abided by
without hesitation, upheld as it is by אCHLP, by all cursives,
virtually by A, 31, completely by the Latin, both Syriac, the
Armenian, and most copies of the Bohairic. It is obvious
also that the writer wishes to impress upon us the fact that out of
so large a party all were saved, and seventy-six would be a small
number indeed. Josephus was wrecked in the Adriatic with
600 on board (Josephus' Life, c. 3: see Whiston's note)<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a>. It
is right, however, to point out that, on the possible supposition
that numeral letters, not words, were employed in St. Luke's
autograph, the difference between B and the Received text
would consist of the insertion or the contrary of the letter ω:
whether in fact it be assumed that the Evangelist wrote ωσοϛ

is very minute, being simply the resolution of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">xi</span></span> into the

ingenious, unless indeed it be regarded as a mistake made

Here, however, as ever, internal evidence being equiponderant,
we must decide by the weight of documentary proof, and adopt

(ܢܚܘܐ ܠܢ ܫܠܡܐ or ܐܡܠܫ ܢܠ ܐܘܚܢ), Bohairic, Ethiopic (in both forms), and Arabic.
Chrysostom too supports this view, and so apparently Tertullian
(<span class="tei tei-q">“monet justificatos ex fide Christi ... pacem ad Deum habere”</span>).

30, 47, 221, 260, 265, &amp;c.), Didymus, Epiphanius, Cyril (once),
and the Slavonic. The later Syriac might seem to combine
both readings (ܢܗܘܐ ܐܬ ܠܢ ܠܘܐ ܐܠܗܐ ܫܝܢܐ or ܐܢܝܫ ܐܗܠܐ ܐܘܠ ܢܠ ܬܐ ܐܘܗܢ): White translates
<span class="tei tei-q">“habemus,”</span> but has no note on the passage<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a>. Had the scales
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been equally poised, no one would hesitate to prefer ἔχομεν, for
the closer the context is examined the clearer it will appear that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inference</span></em> not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exhortation</span></em> is the Apostle's purpose: hence those
who most regard <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient evidence”</span> (Tischendorf and Tregelles,
Westcott and Hort; Lachmann could not make up his mind)
have struggled long before they would admit ἔχωμεν into the
text. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Five Clergymen”</span> who in or about 1858 benefited
the English Church by revising its Authorized version of this
Epistle, even though they render <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">let us have peace with God</span></em>,”</span>
are constrained to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“An overwhelming weight of authority
has necessitated a change, which at the first sight seems to
impair the logical force of the Apostle's argument. No consideration,
however, of this kind can be allowed to interfere
with the faithful exhibition of the true text, as far as it can
be ascertained; and no doubt the real Word of God, thus
faithfully exhibited, will vindicate its own meaning, and need
no help from man's shortsighted preference”</span> (Preface, p. vii).
Every one must honour the reverential temper in which these
eminent men approached their delicate task; yet, if their
sentiments be true, where is the place for internal evidence at
all? A more <span class="tei tei-q">“overwhelming weight”</span> of manuscript authority
upholds καρδίαις in 2 Cor. iii. 3: shall we place it in the text,
<span class="tei tei-q">“leaving the real Word of God to vindicate its own meaning”</span>?
Ought we to assume that the reading found in the few most
ancient codices—not, in the case of Rom. v. 1, in the majority
of the whole collection—must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of necessity</span></em> be the <span class="tei tei-q">“real Word of
God, faithfully exhibited”</span>? I see no cause to reply in the
affirmative, nor do Meyer and Dr. Field<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We conclude, therefore, that this is a case for the application
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paradiplomatical</span></em> canon (VII): that the itacism ω for

some very early copy, from which it was propagated among our
most venerable codices, even those from which the earliest
versions were made:—that this is one out of a small number
of well-ascertained cases in which the united testimonies
of the best authorities conspire in giving a worse reading
than that preserved by later and, on the whole, quite inferior
copies.

34. 1 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cor.</span></span> xi. 24. I am as unwilling as Mr. C. Forster
could have been to strike out from the Received text <span class="tei tei-q">“a word
which (if genuine) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Lord God had spoken</span></span>!”</span> (A new Plea
for the Three Heavenly Witnesses, Preface, p. xvii), but I cannot
censure Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, or Westcott and Hort,
or Dean Blakesley for deciding on the state of the evidence, as
now generally taken, that it is not genuine. Yet it is with great
satisfaction that I find Bp. Chr. Wordsworth able to retain
κλώμενον, and to save the solemn clause τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν from being
<span class="tei tei-q">“bald and impressive without the participle.”</span> Mr. Forster's
argument in behalf of κλώμενον, that it refers to ch. x. 16, τὸν
ἄρτον ὃν κλῶμεν, has a double edge, and might be employed to
indicate the source from which the word crept in here. It is
more to the purpose to urge with Bp. Wordsworth that early
scribes were offended by the apparent inconsistency of the term
with John xix. 36, and because there is nothing like it in the
narratives of the three earlier Evangelists. If we decide to
retain κλώμενον, it must be in opposition to the four chief
manuscripts אABC, though אC insert it by the third hand of
each. Cod. D, like its namesake of the Gospels and Acts, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
somewhat inclined to paraphrases, and has θρυπτόμενον<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> by the
first hand, κλώμενον by the second. Only two cursives here side
with the great uncials (17, and the valuable second hand of 67),
as do Zohrab's Armenian, Cyril of Alexandria and Fulgentius in
the fifth century, and Theodoret's report of Athanasius. The
word κλώμενον is found in EFGKLP, all other cursives, the Latin
versions of DE (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quod frangitur</span></span>), with Ambrosiaster: G and the
interlinear Latin of F, which, as has been already shown under
that MS., is taken from G, prefer <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quod frangetur</span></span>, with both
Syriac, the Gothic, and the Armenian of Uscan. The Latin
Vulgate has <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tradetur</span></span> (but <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">traditur</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">harl.</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>, even in the parallel
column of F and against its Greek, and so Cyprian); the Bohairic
renders <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">traditur</span></span>; but the Sahidic and Ethiopic <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">datur</span></span>, after the
διδόμενον of Zacagni's Euthalius, derived from Luke xxii. 19.
Theodoret himself knew of both forms. The main strength of
κλώμενον rests on Patristic evidence. Mr. Forster has added to
our previous store the <span class="tei tei-q">“conclusive testimony”</span> of Basil (Forster,
p. xxvi) and of Athanasius himself (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. xvii), which is better
than Theodoret's report at second hand; and thus too Chrysostom
in three places, one manuscript of Euthalius, John Damascene,
the Patriarch Germanus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 715, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. xix), Œcumenius and
Theophylact. Mr. Forster is perfectly justified also in pressing
the evidence of the Primitive Liturgies, in all of which κλώμενον
occurs in the most sacred words of Institution (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> pp. xx, xxi).
Whatsoever change these services have received in the course of
ages, they have probably been little altered since the fourth
century, and very well established must the word have then
been to have found a place in them all. On the whole, therefore,
we submit this important text as a proof that the united
readings of אABC are sometimes at variance, not only with the
more modern codices united, but with the text of the oldest
versions and most illustrious Fathers. We confess, however,
that in ver. 29 ἀναξίως (compare ver. 27) and τοῦ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">κύ</span></span> look too
much like glosses to be maintained confidently against the
evidence of א*ABC*, 17, (67**) and some manuscripts of the
Ethiopic.

said to have been favoured by Lachmann in 1831, by Tregelles in
1873 (A. W. Tyler, Bibl. Sacra, 1873, p. 502). Jerome testifies
that in his time <span class="tei tei-q">“apud Graecos ipsos ipsa exemplaria esse diversa,”</span>
and preferred καυχήσωμαι (though all copies of the Latin have <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut

This variation, which involves the change of but one letter, is
worth notice, as showing that the best uncial MSS. are not always
to be depended upon, and sometimes are <span class="tei tei-q">“blemished with errors”</span>
(Wordsworth, N. T., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad loc.</span></span>). As a parallel use, Theodotion's
version of Dan. iii. 8 (παρέδωκαν τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν εἰς πῦρ) is very
pertinent: and for the punishment of burning alive, as practised
in those times, consult (if it be thought needful) Joseph., Antiq.
xvii. 6, 4 (Hort). Καυχήσωμαι may have obtained the more
credit, inasmuch as each of the other principal readings, namely
Tischendorf's καυθήσομαι (DEFGL, 44, 47, 71, 80, 104, 113**,
253**, 254, 255, 257, 260, 265, with nine of Matthaei's, and
some others: καθήσομαι 244) and καυθήσωμαι (CK, 29, 37, and
many others, Chrysostom, Theodoret, &amp;c.) of Lachmann and
Tregelles, are anomalous, the former in respect to mood, the
latter to tense. The important cursive 73 has καυθήσεται with
some Latin copies: Codd. 1, 108*, Basil (perhaps Cyprian) adopt
καυθῇ: the Syriac (ܕܢܐܘܕ or ܕܘܐܢܕ), and I suppose the Arabic, will suit
either of these last. Evidence seems to preponderate on the side
of καυθήσομαι, but in the case of these itacisms manuscripts are
very fallacious we know. Such a subjunctive future as καυθήσωμαι,
however, I should have been disposed to question, had it
not passed muster with much better scholars than I am: but to
illustrate it, as Tregelles does (An Account of the Printed Text,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
p. 117, note), from ἵνα δώσῃ Apoc. viii. 3, is to accomplish little,
since δώσηι is the reading of אAC, 1 (although Erasmus has
δώσῃ with BP, 6, 7, 91, 98, and the Complutensian), 13, 28, 29,
30, 37, 40, 48, 68, 87, 94, 95, 96 (δωσι 8, 26, 27: δω 14), together
with the best copies of Andreas, and is justly approved by
Lachmann and Tischendorf, nay even by Tregelles himself in
his second revision (1872). It seems most likely that in both
places ἵνα, the particle of design, is followed by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indicative</span></em>
future, as (with Meyer and Bp. Ellicott) I think to be clearly
the case in Eph. vi. 3. In John xvii. 3 even Tregelles adopts

36. 1 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cor.</span></span> xv. 51. We have now come to a passage which
has perplexed Biblical students from St. Jerome's time, and has
exercised the keen judgement of Bp. Pearson in his Exposition of
the seventh article of the Apostles' Creed. There is but little
doubt that the Received text, as rendered in our English versions,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is the true reading: (a) Πάντες μὲν οὐ κοιμηθησόμεθα, πάντες δὲ
ἀλλαγησόμεθα. Some of the leading authorities omit μέν, a few
put δέ or γάρ in its place, but, with this trifling exception, the
clause stands thus in B, the third hand of D, and consequently in
EKLP, 37, 47, 265, and indeed nearly all the cursives, as in
some manuscripts known to Jerome, and has the support of
Theodore of Heraclea and Apollinarius: and so the two Syriac,
the Bohairic (the Sahidic not being extant), the Gothic, and one
edition of the Ethiopic version. For the same form may be
cited Ephraem the Syrian, Caesarius, Gregory of Nyssa, and
Chrysostom (often) in the fourth century; Theodoret and
Euthalius in the fifth century; Andreas of Caesarea in the sixth;
John Damascene in the eighth. A modification of this main and
true reading (b) Οὐ πάντες κοιμησόμεθα, πάντες δὲ ἀλλαγησόμεθα is
supported only by Origen and some copies known to Jerome:
it is only a clearer way of bringing out the foregoing sense. The
next form also hardly enters into competition, (c) Πάντες [μὲν]
ἀναστησόμεθα, οὐ πάντες δὲ ἀλλαγήσομεθα: it is supported by the
first hand of D, by the Vulgate (whose manuscripts vary between
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">resurgimus</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">resurgemus</span></span>, while <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span> omits the negative), by
Tertullian and Hilary. Even the Latin versions of EF maintain
it against their own Greek, while Jerome and Augustine note it
as a point wherein the Latin copies diverge from the Greek. A
fourth variation is due to Cod. A alone, (d) Οἱ πάντες μὲν κοιμησόμεθα,
οἱ πάντες δὲ ἀλλαγησόμεθα, the second οι being altered by
the first hand, and ου by the same or a very early hand super-added
after οἱ πάντες δέ: but this is only a correction of transcriptional
error. The real variation consists in the transfer of the
negative from the first clause to the second, (e) Πάντες [μὲν]
κοιμηθησόμεθα, οὐ πάντες δὲ ἀλλαγησόμεθα of אC(F)G, 17, and
apparently of A also by intention. This last is discussed by
Jerome, who alleges in its favour Didymus and Acacius of
Caesarea; it appears also in Origen, Cyril of Alexandria, and in
copies known to Pelagius and Maximus, but their testimony
fluctuates. In its favour are quoted the Armenian and one form
of the Ethiopic, but all the Latin prefer (c) except the interlinear
version of G, and the rendering set above the Vulgate text of F,
which is assimilated to the latter. The Complutensian margin
in a special note chronicles one other change, Πάντες μὲν οὖν
κοιμηθησόμεθα, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ πάντες ἀλλαγησόμεθα, but this is bye-work.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The objection made in ancient times to the Received reading

but St. Paul is here speaking only of the resurrection of the
Just”</span> (Bp. Chr. Wordsworth): compare 1 Thess. iv. 14-17.
Thus Cod. B and the cursives for once unite to convict of falsehood
a change which men were pleased to devise in order to
evade a difficulty of their own making.

pretty widely diffused in the fourth century, though not obtaining
much acceptance even at that period, has almost entirely
disappeared from extant codices. In the place of ἐπιφαύσει σοι
ὁ χριστός the first hand of D, followed of course by E (Sangermanensis)
and the Latin versions of both, exhibits an interesting
variant ἐπιψαύσεις τοῦ χριστοῦ, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">continges Christum</span></span>. Jerome had
heard of it in the form ἐπιψαύσει, id est <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">continget te Christus</span></em>, but
refused to vouch for it, as do Chrysostom and Theodoret, though
they treat it with somewhat more consideration. The Latin interpreter
of Origen (against his own Greek twice, and the Latin
once), with Victorinus and the writer cited as Ambrosiaster,
adopt it as genuine. Augustine (on Psalm iii) has <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">et continget
te</span></span> once, but once elsewhere the common reading. Theodore of
Mopsuestia, in the Latin version of his Commentary on St. Paul's
Epistles, recently edited by Dr. Swete from two manuscripts,
one at Amiens (Cod. 68) brought from Corbey [x], a second from
Cuza, now Harleian. 3063 [ix], after translating <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inluminabit

variation of D* is surely too curious to be lost sight of altogether.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The two imperatives [ἔγειρε and ἀνάστα] doubtless suggested
that the following future would be in the second person, the
required σ stood next after ἐπιφαύσει, easily read as ἐπιψαύσει,

Such are the harmless recreations of a critical genius.

For τινα, to the critic's great perplexity, τις is found in אABCD
EFGKLP, that is, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the uncials extant at this place. As
regards the cursives nearly the same must be said. Of the seventeen
collated by Scrivener, eleven read τις (29, 30, 252, 254, 255,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
257, 258, 260, 265, 266, 277), and six τι (31, 104, 221, 244, 253,
256). Mill enumerates sixteen others that give τις, one (40) that
has τι: Griesbach reckons forty-five in favour of τις, eight (including
Cod. 4) for τι, to which Scholz adds a few more (18, 46, 72, 74).
Thus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am. fuld. tol.</span></span> of the Vulgate render <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">si quid viscera</span></span>, for the
more usual <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">si qua viscera</span></span>. One cursive (109) and a manuscript
of Theodoret have τε. Basil, Chrysostom (in manuscript) and
others read τις, as do the Complutensian, the Aldine (1518),
Erasmus' first four, and R. Stephen's first two editions. In fact
it may be stated that no manuscript whatever has been cited for
τινα, which is not therefore likely to be found in many. Theodore
of Mopsuestia alone, in his Latin version published by Dr. Swete
(vol. i. p. 214), has <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">si qua et viscera</span></span> against the Vulgate. In
spite of what was said above with regard to far weaker cases, it
is impossible to blame editors for putting τις into the text here
before σπλάνχνα: to have acted otherwise (as Tischendorf fairly
observes) would have been <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">grammatici quam editoris partes
agere</span></span>.”</span> Yet we may believe the reading to be as false as it is
intolerable, and to afford us another proof of the early and (as
the cursives show) the well-nigh universal corruption of our
copies in some minute particulars. Of course Clement and later
Fathers give τινα, indeed it is surprising that any cite otherwise;
but, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the absence of definite documentary proof</span></em>, this can hardly
be regarded as genuine. Probably St. Paul wrote τι (the reading
of about nineteen cursives), which would readily be corrupted
into τις, by reason of the σ following (ΤΙΣΠΛΑΓΧΝΑ), and the
τις which had just preceded. See also Moulton's <span class="tei tei-q">“Winer,”</span> p. 661,

that the verse should end with θεοῦ, all additions, including
χριστοῦ the simplest, being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accretions</span></em> to the genuine passage.
These alleged accretions are τοῦ θεοῦ ὅ ἐστι χριστός, manifestly
an expansion of χριστοῦ and derived from ch. i. 27; τοῦ θεοῦ
πατρὸς τοῦ χριστοῦ: τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ χριστοῦ, the final
form of the Received text. Now, of these four readings, τοῦ θεοῦ
the shortest, and, according to Griesbach, Scholz, Tischendorf in
his seventh edition, Alford, and Dr. Green, the true one, is found
only in the late uncial P, and in a few, though confessedly good,
cursives: 37, 71, 80*, 116 (καὶ θεοῦ 23), and the important second
hand of 67; witnesses too few and feeble, unless we consent to
put our third Canon of internal evidence to a rather violent use.
Of the longer readings, ὅ ἐστιν χριστός is favoured by D (though
obelized by the second hand, which thus would read only τοῦ
θεοῦ), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> (whose parallel Greek speaks differently), by Augustine
and Vigilius of Thapsus, but apparently by no cursives. The
form best vouched for appears to be that of א*AC, 4, of the
Sahidic according to one of the readings of Griesbach, and of an
Arabic codex of Tischendorf, τοῦ θεοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ (א* omits τοῦ)
χριστοῦ. To these words <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ihu</span></span>”</span> is simply added by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span> (FG, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span> are
unfortunately lost here) and by other manuscripts of the Vulgate
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am. fuld.</span></span>, &amp;c.), though the Clementine edition has <span class="tei tei-q">“Dei patris
et Christi Jesu,”</span> the Complutensian in the Latin <span class="tei tei-q">“dei et patris
et C.J.”</span> With the Clementine Vulgate agree the Bohairic, and
(omitting ἰησοῦ) the Peshitto Syriac, Arabic, 47, 73, Chrysostom;
while 41, 115, 213, 221, 253* (τοῦ θ. καὶ π. τοῦ χ.), so far strengthen
the case of אAC. The Received text is found in (apparently)
the great mass of cursives, in D (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tertiâ manu</span></span>), EKL, the Harkleian
Syriac (but the καί after πατρός marked with one of Harkel's
asterisks), Theodoret, John Damascene and others. The minor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
variations, τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν χριστῷ of Clement and Ambrosiaster, τοῦ
θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν χριστῷ of 17, uphold D*, as may the Ethiopic (<span class="tei tei-q">“domini
quod de Christo”</span>): to the reading of Cod. 17 Zohrab's or the
Venice Armenian (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1789) simply adds <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesu.”</span> We also find
<span class="tei tei-q">“dei Christi Jesu patris et domini”</span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tol.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“dei patris et domini
nostri Christi”</span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demid.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“dei patris in Christo Jesu”</span> in Uscan's
Armenian; but these deserve not attention. Theodore of
Mopsuestia (Swete, vol. i. p. 283), has <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mysterii Dei Patris et
Christi</span></span>, which need not imply the omission of καί before πατρός.

On reviewing the whole mass of conflicting evidence, we may
unhesitatingly reject the shortest form τοῦ θεοῦ, some of whose
maintainers do not usually found their text on cursive manuscripts
almost exclusively. We would gladly adopt τοῦ θεοῦ
χριστοῦ, so powerfully do internal considerations plead in its
favour, were it but a little better supported: the important doctrine
which it declares, Scriptural and Catholic as that is, will
naturally make us only the more cautious in receiving it unreservedly.
Yet the more we think over this reading, the more it
grows upon us, as the source from which all the rest are derived.
At present, perhaps, τοῦ θεοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ χριστοῦ may be looked
upon as the most strongly attested, but in the presence of so
many opposing probabilities, a very small weight might suffice
to turn the critical scale.

40. 1 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Thess.</span></span> ii. 7. We have here a various reading, consisting
of the prefix of a single letter, which seems to introduce
into a simple verse what is little short of an absurdity. Instead
of ἤπιοι of the Received text, of Tischendorf and Tregelles, we
find νήπιοι adopted by Lachmann as a consequence of his own
stringent rules, and by Westcott and Hort of their own free will,
unless indeed it be said that they also are working in chains of
their own forging. How St. Paul can compare himself to a babe
in one clause of the verse and to its nurse in the other would be
quite unintelligible if Origen, who read νήπιοι, had not instructed
us that the nurse is playing at baby for the babe's amusement
(ἐγένετο νήπιος καὶ παραπλήσιος τροφῷ θαλπούσῃ τὸ ἑαυτῆς παιδίον καὶ
λαλούσῃ λόγους ὡς παιδίον διὰ τὸ παιδίον, iii. 662). It needs but the
exercise of common sense to brush away such a fancy as this,
and the state of the evidence will show us how the best authorities
are sometimes hopelessly in the wrong; for νήπιοι is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
form favoured by א*BC*D*FG, 5, 23, 26, 31* 37, 39**, 74, 87,
109**, 114, 115, 137, 219<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">*</span></span>, 252, and is easily accounted for by the
accidental reduplication of the letter after Ν in ΗΜΕΝΗΠΙΟΙ
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg010" class="tei tei-ref">10</a>). The Vulgate and the Latin versions accompanying
DEFG (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> testifying against its own Greek) have <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">parvuli</span></span>, and
so the Bohairic, Ethiopic, Clement of Alexandria (ἤπιος οὖν ὁ
νήπιος), Ambrosiaster, Jerome, and Augustine very expressly.
On the other hand ἤπιος is vouched for by א**AC**D**EKLP,
17, 47, 61, 260, and by all cursives not named above, by both
Syriac versions, by the Sahidic and by its follower the Bashmuric,
by the Armenian, by Clement and Origen elsewhere (but their
inconsistency means nothing but carelessness), Basil, Chrysostom,

both readings. It is almost pathetic to mark Dr. Hort's brave
struggle to maintain a cause which in this instance is simply
hopeless. <span class="tei tei-q">“The second ν might be inserted or omitted with equal
facility; but the change from the bold image to the tame and

not of harshness that St. Paul here declares himself innocent, but

two horizontal strokes; hence it is rather to be regretted than
wondered at that the true reading of each of the uncial authorities
for the former is more or less open to question. Respecting
Cod. א we have the statement of Tischendorf, a most consummate
judge in such matters: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">corrector aliquis, qui omnium ultimus

unequivocal enough: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> facsimile No. 13 in Scrivener's <span class="tei tei-q">“Collation
of Cod. Sin.,”</span> and Introd., p. xxv: also Plate iv, facsimile
No. 11 c of this volume, wherein the twelfth century θε above
the line, the new accent over ΟΣ, and the triple points to denote
insertion, are very conspicuous. Nor is there any real doubt
respecting the kindred codices FG. From the photographed
title-page of the published <span class="tei tei-q">“Cod. Augiensis”</span> (F) l. 9, and
Matthaei's facsimile of G (N. T., vol. i. p. 4)<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a>, it will be seen that
while there is not the least trace of the horizontal line within
the circle of omicron, the line above the circle in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span>) is not
horizontal, but rises a little towards the right: such a line not
unfrequently in F, oftener in G, is used (as here) to indicate the
rough breathing: it sometimes stands even for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lenis</span></span> (e.g. ἱδιον
1 Cor. vi. 18; vii. 4; 37; ἱσσα Phil. ii. 6). Those who never
saw Cod. C must depend on Tischendorf's Excursus (Cod.
Ephraemi, pp. 39-42) and his facsimile, imitated in our Plate x.
No. 24. His decision is that the primitive reading was ΟΣ, but
he was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first to discern a cross line within</span></em> Ο (facsimile, l. 3,
eighth letter); which, however, from the colour (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">subnigra</span></span>”</span>) he
judges to belong to the second or third hand, rising upwards
(a tendency rather exaggerated than otherwise in our Plate);
while the coarse line above, and the musical notes (denoting
a word of two syllables) below, are plainly of the third hand.
This verdict, especially delivered by such a man, we know not
how to gainsay, and merely point to the fact that the cross line
in Θ, the ninth letter further on, which is certainly <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>,
also ascends towards the right. Cod. A, however, I have
examined at least twenty times within as many years, and yet
am not quite able to assent to the conclusion of Mr. Cowper
when he says <span class="tei tei-q">“we hope that no one will think it possible,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
either with or without a lens, to ascertain the truth of the matter
by any inspection of the Codex”</span> (Cod. Alex., Introd. p. xviii).
On the contrary, seeing (as every one must see for himself) with
my own eyes, I have always felt convinced with Berriman and
the earlier collators that Cod. A read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>, and, so far as I am
shaken in my conviction at all, it is less by the adverse opinion
even of Bp. Ellicott<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a>, than by the more recently discovered fact
that ΟΣ (which is adopted by Griesbach, Lachmann, Tischendorf,
Davidson, Tregelles, Alford, Ellicott, Wordsworth, Hort and
Westcott), was read in א as early as the fourth century.

The secondary witnesses, versions, and certain of the Fathers,
also powerfully incline this way, and they deserve peculiar
attention in a case like the present. The Peshitto (ܕ) and
Harkleian (text and ܗܘ in margin) Syriac have a relative
(whether ὅς or ὅ); so have the Armenian, the Roman Ethiopic,
and Erpenius' Arabic. The Gothic supports ὅς; the Sahidic,
Bohairic, and Platt's Ethiopic favour ὅς or ὅ: all Latin versions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

only in the Slavonic (which usually resembles KL and the later
copies) and the Polyglott Arabic. Of ecclesiastical writers the
best witness for the Received text is Ignatius, Θεοῦ ἀνθρωπίνως
φανερουμένου (<span class="tei tei-q">“Ephes.”</span> 19), both in the Greek and Old Latin,
although the Syriac abbreviator seems to have τοῦ υἱοῦ: the later
interpolator expanded the clause thus: θεοῦ ὡς ἀνθρώπου φαινομένου,
καὶ ἀνθρώπου ὡς θεοῦ ἐνεργοῦντος. Hippolytus (Adv. Not. 17:
fl. 220) makes a <span class="tei tei-q">“free reference”</span> to it in the words Οὗτος προελθὼν
εἰς κόσμον, θεὸς ἐν σώματι ἐφανερώθη, and elsewhere with ὁ before
προελθών. The testimony of Dionysius of Alexandria (265) can
no longer be upheld (Tregelles, Horne, iv. p. 339), that of
Chrysostom to the same effect is by some deemed precarious, since
his manuscripts fluctuate, and Cramer's catena on 1 Tim. p. 31 is
adverse<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a>. The evidence borne for θεός by Didymus (de Trin.)

Theodoret, John Damascene, Theophylact, Œcumenius (as might
be looked for) is clear and express. The chief Latins, Hilary,

of a relative; add to which that θεός is not quoted by Fathers
(e.g. Cyprian, p. 35; Bentleii Critica Sacra, p. 67) in many
places where it might fairly be looked for; though this argument
must not be pushed too far. The idle tale, propagated
by Liberatus the Deacon of Carthage, and from him repeated by
Hincmar and Victor, that Macedonius Patriarch of Constantinople
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 506) was expelled by the Emperor Anastasius for
corrupting Ο or ΟΣ into ΘΣ, although lightly credited by
Dr. Tregelles (An Account of the Printed Text, p. 229) and even
by Dr. Hort (Notes, p. 133), is sufficiently refuted by Bp. Pearson
(On the Creed, Art. ii. p. 128, 3rd edition).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On a review of the whole mass of external proof, bearing in
mind too that ΟΣ (from which ὅ of D* is an evident corruption)
is grammatically much the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harder</span></em> reading after μυστήριον
(Canon I), and that it might easily pass into ΘΣ, we must consider
it probable (indeed, if we were sure of the testimony of the first-rate
uncials, we might regard it as certain) that the second of
our rules of Comparative Criticism must here be applied, and
θεός of the more recent many yield place to ὅς of the ancient
few<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a>. Yet even then the force of the Patristic testimony remains
untouched. Were we to concede to Dr. Hort's unproved hypothesis
that Didymus, de Trinitate, abounds in what he calls
Syrian readings, and that they are not rare with Gregory
Nyssen (Notes, p. 133), the clear references of Ignatius and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hippolytus are not thus to be disposed of. I dare not pronounce
θεός a corruption.

This decision of Dr. Scrivener would probably have been
considerably strengthened in favour of θεός, if the above passage
had been written after, instead of before, the composition and
appearance of Dean Burgon's elaborate and patient examination
of all the evidence, which occupies seventy-seven pages in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Revision Revised”</span> (pp. 424-501). Dean Burgon shows at length
that after about 1770 the passage in A became so worn that it
has been since that time increasingly difficult to see it; he casts
much doubt upon the witness of C for ὅς, which Mr. Hoskier
(Cod. 604, Appendix J), after a long examination of the MS., not
only confirms, but actually removes in the opposite direction by
claiming C as a witness for θεός; he maintains with reason that
the transverse line in F and G is the sign of contraction; he
exhibits the consentient testimony of the cursives; he claims
upon the testimony of the scholar who was editing the Harkleian
that version, as also the Georgian and Slavonic; and he adds to
the Fathers enumerated above, besides doubtful testimonies,
Gregory of Nazianzus, Cyril of Alexandria, Severus of Antioch,
Diodorus of Tarsus, Euthalius, Macedonius, Epiphanius of Catana,
Theodorus Studita, Euthymius, some scholia, the author of Περὶ
θείας σαρκώσεως, and an anonymous author,—making some fifty

is to be regarded as the true form. We find ι in אAB, 101, 104
only, nor is it quite accurate to say with Tischendorf that collators
are apt to overlook such points. In KLP, and apparently
in all other manuscripts of every class, η is read, and so the
catenas, with Theophylact and Œcumenius, understand this
difficult passage. That all the versions (Latin, Syriac, Egyptian,
&amp;c.) thus render seems decisive in favour of η. The
combination of אAB, however strong, has repeatedly been seen
not to be irresistible; and while it must be confessed that in
our existing Greek copies the interchange of ι and η (though
found in Cod. A) is not an itacism of the very oldest type (p. 10),
yet here the testimony of the versions refers it back to the
second century. Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott
and Hort, combine in reading κατῴκισεν.

Against this very strong case we can set up for the common
text only the more recent uncials KLP (not more than seven
uncials contain this Epistle), the mass of later cursives (ten out
of Scrivener's twelve, also Wake 12, or Cod. 193), the Polyglott
Arabic, Slavonic, Theophylact, and Œcumenius, authorities of the
ninth century and downwards. It is a real pleasure to me in

(An Account of the Printed Text, p. 285). I would further allege
this text as one out of many proofs that the great uncials seldom
or never conspire in exhibiting a really valuable departure from
the later codices, unless supported by some of the best of the
cursives themselves. See, however, Acts xiii. 32.

48. 2 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pet.</span></span> ii. 13. The resemblance between the second epistle
of St. Peter and that of St. Jude is too close to be unobserved by
the most careless reader, and the supposition that the elder
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Apostle's letter was in Jude's hands when he wrote his own is
that which best meets the circumstances of the case. The σπῖλοι
of the present verse, for example, looks like the origin of σπιλάδες
in Jude 12, where the latter word is employed in a signification
almost unprecedented in classical Greek, though the Orphic
poems have been cited for its bearing the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“spots,”</span> which
all the ancient versions rightly agree with our Authorized Bible
in attributing to it. Bearing in mind the same verse of St. Jude,
it seems plain that ἀπάταις of the Received text cannot be
accepted as true, as well because it affords so poor a meaning
in connexion with ἐντρυφῶντες and συνευωχούμενοι, as because the
later writer must have seen ἀγάπαις in his model, when he
paraphrased it by οἱ ἐν ταῖς ἀγάπαις ὑμῶν σπιλάδες συνευωχούμενοι.
For this change of two letters we have the support of Cod. A
(as corrected by the first hand) and B alone of the manuscripts,
but of the versions, the Latin Speculum <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span> which in these later
epistles is strangely loose, yet cannot be misunderstood in the
present place, the Vulgate, the Sahidic version, the Ethiopic,
the Syriac printed with the Peshitto<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a>, and the margin of the
Harkleian version. Add to these Ephraem and the Latin author
of the tract <span class="tei tei-q">“de singularitate clericorum,”</span> both of the fourth
century. The little group of cursives 27, 29, and the second
hand of 66 read ἀγνοίαις; but ἀπάταις, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nescio quo sensu</span></span><a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a>, still

cleaves to the text of Tischendorf and of Westcott and Hort, and
to the margin of Tregelles, who in the text prefers ἀγάπαις with
Lachmann and Westcott and Hort's margin. Codd. אA (in its
original form) CKLP, all other cursives, the catenas (Cod. 36,
&amp;c.), the Bohairic, Armenian, and Harkleian versions also have
ἀπάταις, and so Theophylact and Œcumenius, but hardly Jerome

τὸν πατέρα ἔχει (which appears to have been lost out of some

Testament in 1582<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a>, it is approved by all modern editors
(Griesbach, Scholz, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott
and Hort), and, though still absent from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">textus receptus</span></span>, is
unquestionably genuine. This is just such a point as versions
are best capable of attesting. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Bible”</span> had no doubt
taken the clause from the Latin Vulgate, in whose printed
editions and chief manuscripts it is found (e.g. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am. fuld.

Sahidic not for certain), the Armenian, Ethiopic, and Erpenius'
(not the Polyglott) Arabic version. Of manuscripts the great
uncials אABC (with P) contain the clause, the later KL omit it.
Of the cursives only two of Scrivener's (182, 225) have it, and
another (183) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundâ manu</span></span>: from twelve or more of them it is
absent, as also from seven of Matthaei's: but of the other cursives
it is present in at least thirty, whereof 3, 5, 13, 66** (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">marg.</span></span>), 68,
69, 98 are valuable. It is also acknowledged by Clement, Origen
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thrice</span></em>), Eusebius, both Cyrils, Theophylact, and the Western
Fathers. The younger Cyril, possibly Euthalius, and one or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The authenticity of the words within brackets will, perhaps,

those of very late date, one of them (Cod. Ravianus, Evan. 110)
being a mere worthless copy from printed books; and in the
margin of a fourth, in a hand as late as the sixteenth century.
The real witnesses are the Codex Montfortianus, Evan. 61,
Act. 34 (whose history was described above, p. 187<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>); Cod. Vat.-Ottob.
298 (Act. 162), and, for the margin, a Naples manuscript
(Act. 83 or 173, q. v.). On comparing these slight and scanty
authorities with the Received text we find that they present the
following variations: ver. 7. ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro</span></span> ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ)

found to agree with either 34 or 162 (173, whose margin is so
very recent, only differs from the common text by dropping
ν ἐφελκυστικόν), though on the whole 162 best suits the Complutensian:
but the omission of the article in ver. 7, while it
stands in ver. 8 in 162, proves that the disputed clause was
interpolated (probably from its parallel Latin) by one who was
very ill acquainted with Greek.

add Codd. 190, 193, 219-221), besides some sixty Lectionaries.
The aspect of things is not materially altered when we consult
the versions. The disputed clause is not in any manuscript of
the Peshitto, nor in the best editions (e.g. Lee's): the Harkleian,
Sahidic, Bohairic, Ethiopic, Arabic do not contain it in any
shape: scarcely any Armenian codex exhibits it, and only a few
recent Slavonic copies, the margin of a Moscow edition of
1663 being the first to represent it. The Latin versions,
therefore, alone lend it any support, and even these are
much divided. The chief and oldest authority in its favour is
Wiseman's Speculum <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span> of the earlier translation; it is
found in the printed Latin Vulgate, and in perhaps forty-nine
out of every fifty of its manuscripts, but not in the best, such as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am. fuld. harl.</span></span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></span>; nor in Alcuin's reputed copies at Rome (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ
manu</span></span>) and London (Brit. Mus. Add. 10,546), nor in the book
of Armagh and full fifty others. In one of the most ancient
which contain it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cav.</span></span>, ver. 8 precedes ver. 7 (as appears also in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m. tol. demid.</span></span> and a codex at Wolfenbüttel, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wizanburg.</span></span> 99
[viii] cited by Lachmann), while in the margin is written <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">audiat

general there is very considerable variety of reading (always
a suspicious circumstance, as has been already explained), and
often the doubtful words stand only in the margin: the last
clause of ver. 8 (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">et hi tres unum sunt</span></span>), especially, is frequently
left out when the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Witnesses”</span> are retained. It is to
defend <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> omission by the opinion of Thomas Aquinas, not to
account for the reception of the doubtful words, that the
Complutensian editors wrote a note, the longest and indeed
almost the only one in their New Testament. We conclude,
therefore, that the passage from ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ to ἐν τῇ γῇ had no
place in ancient Greek manuscripts, but came into some of the
Latin at least as early as the sixth century.

The Patristic testimony in its favour, though quite insufficient
to establish the genuineness of the clause, is entitled to more
consideration. Of the Greek Fathers it has been said that no
one has cited it, even when it might be supposed to be most
required by his argument, or though he quotes consecutively the
verses going immediately before and after it<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a>: [but a passage
occurs in the Greek Synopsis of Holy Scripture of uncertain
date (fourth or fifth century), which appears to refer to it, and
another from the Disputation with Arius (Ps.-Athanasius)]. The
same must be said of the great Latins, Hilary, Lucifer, Ambrose,
Jerome<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a>, and Augustine, with others of less note. On the other
hand the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">African</span></em> writers, Vigilius of Thapsus, at the end of the
fifth century, and Fulgentius of Ruspe (fl. 508) in two places,
expressly appeal to the <span class="tei tei-q">“three Heavenly Witnesses”</span> as a genuine
portion of St. John's Epistle; nor is there much reason to doubt
the testimony of Victor Vitensis, who records that the passage
was insisted on in a confession of faith drawn up by Eugenius
Bishop of Carthage and 460 bishops in 484, and presented to
the Arian Hunneric, king of the Vandals [or of Cassiodorus, an
Italian, in the sixth century]. From that period the clause became
well known in other regions of the West, and was in time
generally accepted throughout the Latin Church.

But a stand has been made by the maintainers of this passage
on the evidence of two African Fathers of a very different stamp
from those hitherto named, Tertullian and Cyprian. If it could
be proved that these writers cited or alluded to the passage, it
would result—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not by any means that it is authentic</span></em>—but that
like Acts viii. 37 and a few other like interpolations, it was
known and received in some places, as early as the second or
third century. Now as regards the language of Tertullian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(which will be found in Tischendorf's and the other critical
editions of the N. T.; advers. Prax. 25; de Pudic. 21), it must
be admitted that Bp. Kaye's view is the most reasonable, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“far from containing an allusion to 1 John v. 7, it furnishes most
decisive proof that he knew nothing of the verse”</span> (Writings of
Tertullian, p. 550, second edition); but I cannot thus dispose of
his junior Cyprian (d. 258). One must say with Tischendorf
(who, however, manages to explain away his testimony)
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gravissimus est</span></span> Cyprianus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de eccles. unitate</span></span> 5.”</span> His words run,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Dicit dominus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego et pater unum sumus</span></em> (John x. 30), et
iterum de Patre, et Filio, et Spiritu Sancto scriptum est, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Et tres
unum sunt</span></em>.”</span> And yet further, in his Epistle to Jubaianus (73)
on heretical baptism: <span class="tei tei-q">“Si baptizari quis apud haereticos potuit,
utique et remissam peccatorum consequi potuit,—si peccatorum
remissam consecutus est, et sanctificatus est, et templum Dei
factus est, quaero cujus Dei? Si Creatoris, non potuit, qui in
eum non credidit; si Christi, nec hujus fieri potuit templum, qui
negat Deum Christum; si Spiritus Sancti, cum tres unum sunt,
quomodo Spiritus Sanctus placatus esse ei potest, qui aut Patris
aut Filii inimicus est?”</span> If these two passages be taken together
(the first is manifestly much the stronger<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a>), it is surely safer and
more candid to admit that Cyprian read ver. 7 in his copies, than
to resort to the explanation of Facundus [vi], that the holy
Bishop was merely putting on ver. 8 a spiritual meaning;
although we must acknowledge that it was in this way ver. 7
obtained a place, first in the margin, then in the text of the
Latin copies, and though we have clear examples of the like
mystical interpretation in Eucherius (fl. 440) and Augustine
(contra Maximin. 22), who only knew of ver. 8.

Stunica, the chief Complutensian editor, by declaring, in controversy
with Erasmus, with reference to this very passage,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sciendum est, Graecorum codices esse corruptos, nostros
[i.e. Latinos] verò ipsam veritatem continere,”</span> virtually admits
that ver. 7 was translated in that edition from the Latin, not
derived from Greek sources. The versions (for such we must
call them) in Codd. 34, 162 had no doubt the same origin, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were somewhat worse rendered: the margin of 173 seems to be
taken from a printed book. Erasmus, after excluding the
passage from his first two editions, inserted it in his third under
circumstances we have before mentioned; and notwithstanding
the discrepancy of reading in ver. 8, there can be little or no
doubt of the identity of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Codex Britannicus”</span> with Montfort's<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a>.
We have detailed the steps by which the text was
brought into its present shape, wherein it long remained,
unchallenged by all save a few such bold spirits as Bentley,
defended even by Mill, implicitly trusted in by those who had
no knowledge of Biblical criticism. It was questioned in fair
argument by Wetstein, assailed by Gibbon in 1781 with his
usual weapons, sarcasm and insinuation (Decline and Fall,
chap. xxxvii). Archdeacon Travis, who came to the rescue,
a person <span class="tei tei-q">“of some talent and attainments”</span> (Crito Cantab., p. 335,
note), burdened as he was with a weak cause and undue confidence
in its goodness, would have been at any rate—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">impar

On the whole, therefore, we need not hesitate to declare our
conviction that the disputed words were not written by St. John:
that they were originally brought into Latin copies in Africa
from the margin, where they had been placed as a pious and
orthodox gloss on ver. 8: that from the Latin they crept into
two or three late Greek codices, and thence into the printed
Greek text, a place to which they had no rightful claim. We
will close this slight review with the terse and measured
judgement of Griesbach on the subject: <span class="tei tei-q">“Si tam pauci, dubii,
suspecti, recentes testes, et argumenta tam levia, sufficerent ad

text, we have the perfect γεγεννημένος of continued effects and
the aorist γεννηθείς of completed action used for the same person,
although elsewhere in the same Epistle the man begotten of God
is invariably γεγεννημένος (ch. ii. 29; iii. 9 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></span>; iv. 7; v. 1, 4).
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hence the special importance of the various reading αὐτόν for
ἑαυτόν after τηρεῖ, since, if this were to be accepted, ὁ γεννηθείς
could be none other than the Only-begotten Son who keepeth
the human sons of God, agreeably to His own declaration in
John xvii. 12<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>. In behalf of αὐτόν we can allege only AB, 105
(a cursive collated by Matthaei), and the Vulgate (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conservat eum</span></span>),
the testimony of A, always so powerful when sanctioned by B,
being nothing weakened by the fact that it is corrected into
ἑαυτόν by the original [?] scribe<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a>, who in copying had faithfully

a class Dean Vaughan speaks of, which, seeming violently
improbable at first sight, grows upon the student as he becomes
familiar with it. It must be confessed, however, that St. Paul
makes but slight distinction between the two tenses in Gal. iv.
23, 29, and that we have no other example in Scripture or
ecclesiastical writers of ὁ γεννηθείς being used absolutely for the
Divine Son, though the contrast here suggested is somewhat
countenanced by that between ὁ ἁγιάζων and οἱ ἁγιαζόμενοι in
Heb. ii. 11. [So that Dr. Scrivener's view demands considerable
sacrifice for its acceptance.]

C<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">*</span></span>, so that it must at any rate resign its place; while for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΚΣ</span></span> of

the Armenian (with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ισ</span></span> in the margin), the Arabic of Erpenius,

we acknowledge that the Person who saved Israel out of Egypt
was indeed the Saviour of the world, we should rather expect

Lachmann alone reads Ἰησοῦς here, though Tregelles gives it
a place in his margin. Westcott and Hort would be acting on
their general principle if they received it, but, while setting
Κύριος in the text and Ἰησοῦς in the margin, they brand the
passage as corrupt, and would be inclined to believe that the
original words were ὁ ... σώσας, without either of the nouns.
Dr. Hort (Notes, p. 106) points out how slight the change would
be from ΟΤΙΟ to ΟΤΙΣ (one Ι being dropped) in the simple
uncials of early times.

ὑπάγει. This reading of the Received text is perfectly clear;
indeed, when compared with what is found in the best manuscripts,
it is too simple to be true (Canon I, Chap. VIII). We read
in Codd. אBC: ει (C) τις εις αιχμαλωσιαν ὑπαγει (ὑπάγῃ B), the
reading also of those excellent cursives 28, 38, 79, 95, and of a
manuscript of Andreas: εἰς is further omitted in 14 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>), and in
92 its echo, in 32, 47, the Bohairic (?), Arabic (Polyglott), and
a Slavonic manuscript: and so Tregelles in 1872. The sense of
this reading, if admissible at all, is very harsh and elliptical;

any one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> for captivity, into captivity he goeth”</span> (Tregelles,
Kelly: the latter compares Jer. xv. 2, LXX): the second εἰς
αἰχμαλωσίαν being omitted by Homoeoteleuton in the above-mentioned
codices. Tregelles (in 1844), Lachmann, Tischendorf,
Kelly, Westcott and Hort follow Cod. A, and it would seem
rightly.

All other variations were devised for the purpose of supplying
the ellipsis left in the uncials. For συνάγει of the common text
(now that it is known not to be found in C) no Greek authority
is expressly cited except Reuchlin's Cod. 1, after Andreas (whence
it came into the text of Erasmus) and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recent</span></em> margin of 94.
The favourite form of the cursives is that printed in the Complutensian
Polyglott: εἴ τις ἔχει αἰχμαλωσίαν, ὑπάγει, after P, 2, 6, 8,
13, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 37, 40, 41, 42, 48, 49, 50, 89, 90, 91, 93, 94<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">*</span></span>,
96, 97, 98, perhaps some six others, a Slavonic manuscript,
Andreas in the edition of 1596. The Vulgate, the Latin version
printed with the Peshitto Syriac, and Primasius in substance,
read <span class="tei tei-q">“Qui in captivitatem duxerit, in captivitatem
vadet,”</span> but (as we stated above) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am. fuld.</span></span> (not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demid.</span></span>) and the
best codices omit <span class="tei tei-q">“duxerit”</span> and have <span class="tei tei-q">“vadit”</span> (Syr. ܡܘܒܥ ... ܐܙܥ or ܥܙܐ ... ܥܒܘܡ),
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which brings the clause into accordance with Cod. A.</span></em> The
Greek corresponding with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">printed</span></em> Vulgate is εἴ τις εἰς (33
omits εἰς) αἰχμαλωσίαν (ὑπάγει 87), εἰς (ἐς 87) αἰχμαλωσίαν ὑπάγει,
33, 35, 87. Other modes of expression (e.g. εἴ τις αἰχμαλωτίζει
εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν ὑπάγει, 7; εἴ τις αἰχμαλωτιεῖ, αἰχμαλωτισθήσεται, 18;
εἴ τις αἰχμαλωτησεῖ, εἰς αἰχ. ὑπ. 36, &amp;c.) resemble those already
given, in their attempt to enlarge and soften what was originally

present the variation λίθον for λίνον <span class="tei tei-q">“arrayed with stone,”</span> i.e.
precious stone, for which καθαρόν <span class="tei tei-q">“clean”</span> would be no appropriate
epithet. Dr. Hort (Notes, p. 139) justifies what he rightly calls
<span class="tei tei-q">“the bold image expressed by this well-attested reading”</span> by
Ezek. xxviii. 13 πάντα λίθον χρηστὸν ἐνδέδεσαι (or ἐνδέδυσαι), σάρδιον

Andreas knew of the variation without adopting it: Haymo
and Bede also mention both readings. Cod. א reads καθαροὺς
λίνους with the Bohairic, and so helped to keep Tischendorf
right: Tregelles sets this form in his margin. For λίνον or
λινοῦν or λην- we have all the other manuscripts and other
authorities, including BP, that excellent cursive Cod. 95,
Primasius. Between the two forms with ν we should probably
choose λινοῦν of B, [7], 14, 18, 92, 97, as λίνον seems to belong to
the raw material in a rough state. The later Syriac has
ܒܬܢܐ (or ܐܢܬܒ) (χιτῶνα), which admits of no ambiguity.

have πέπτωκαν. Dr. Hort has no note on this place, but treats
it in his index of <span class="tei tei-q">“Quotations from the Old Testament”</span> as
a reference to Isa. li. 17, 22 (ἡ πιοῦσα τὸ ποτήριον τῆς πτώσεως)
and to Jer. xxv. 27 (πίετε καὶ μεθύσθητε ... καὶ πεσεῖσθε), with the
notion of stumbling through drink. What is required to complete
the parallel is some passage in the Septuagint wherein
πέπτωκαν stands alone, whether τοῦ οἴνου be in the text or not,
and, in the absence of such parallel, πέπτωκαν must be regarded
as incredible on any evidence. Yet πέπτωκαν or the virtually
identical πεπτώκασιν is found in אAC, in B, 7, 8, 14, 25, 27, 29, 91,
92, 94, 95 (πέπτωσι <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>), the Bohairic and Ethiopic.
The alternative reading πέπωκαν or πεπώκασιν (πέπωκε 96) occurs

divided in a case where the omission of a single letter produces
so great a change in the sense.

or without εἰμι after ἐγώ, by Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles,
Kelly, Archdeacon Lee in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Speaker's Commentary,”</span> Westcott

conspicuous in the Apocalypse: its compeer C is defective here.
The very valuable Apoc. 38 confirms it (γεγόνασιν), as did א<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>, but
the whole word was afterwards erased: the interpreter of

read γέγονα, most of them omitting either the ἐγώ or the ἐγώ
εἰμι which follows. Erasmus was too good a scholar to adopt
from Apoc. 1 a meaning for γίγνομαι which it cannot possibly
bear, and seems to have got his own reading Γέγονε (though he
recognizes that of Apoc. 1 in his Annotations) from the Vulgate
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">factum est</span></span>, which is confirmed by Primasius: it probably has no
Greek authority whatsoever. The Syriac printed with the
Peshitto (commonly assigned to the sixth century) appears, like
the hand which followed א<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>, to omit γέγονα, as do the Bohairic
and Ethiopic versions, with <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lux.</span></span> of the Vulgate. Those which
read γέγονα yet retain the following ἐγώ (אBP, 7 and some others)
obviously differ from the true reading γέγοναν by the single
stroke which in uncial manuscripts was set over a letter to
represent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nu</span></span>, especially at the end of a line, and so avoid
the monstrous rendering necessarily implied in 1, 8, 93, 96, 97,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A very interesting group of Syriac manuscripts is found in the collections
of Syriac MS. Lectionaries which have descended to us. That the
number of them is large may be inferred from the fact that thirty-five
may be found in the British Museum alone (Catalogue, i. pp. 146-203).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Syriac Lectionaries are of two classes, (i) those according to the Greek
Use, and (ii) those according to the native Syriac Use. The former, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malkite</span></span> Lectionaries, may be dismissed from the present enquiry. They
are only Greek works in a Syriac dress, and their value is historical rather
than critical<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The true Syriac Lectionaries, whether Jacobite or Nestorian, follow as
to their main features the Greek Lectionaries which have been described
in our first volume, coming under two main classes, Evangelistaries and
Apostolos<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a>. But they present one important contrast. In both families
of Syriac descent, the Ecclesiastical year begins with Advent, and not,
as in Greek Lectionaries, with Easter; and in general the arrangement
is similar in both, so that the system must at least be of considerably
greater antiquity than the days of the schism. In some of the Jacobite
copies the text of the Harkleian revision has been substituted for the
ancient Peshitto. Some include Lessons from the Old Testament. Some
contain a Menology. In a few instances the Lessons for special festivals
form a separate volume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The majority of the Syriac MS. Lectionaries are comparatively late,
but others possess an antiquity which, in the case of some MSS., would
be considered remarkable. The British Museum copies, Add. 14,485
and 14,486, are each dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a. gr.</span></span> 1135 = <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 824. Others must be
referred to the same century. Add. 14,528, foll. 152-228 (an Index),
and the leaf in Add. 17,217, appear to be three centuries older. Another
sixth century MS., Add. 14,455 (the Four Gospels), contains many
Rubrics, a pr. m. in the text, besides those in the margins by later hands,
such as occur in MSS. of all ages. When to these facts we add the
consideration already mentioned, that the same system was in use in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both branches of the Syrian Church, we see the importance of the
testimony of works of this class. They are very ancient ecclesiastical
records from the unchangeable East. Like Greek Lectionaries, they are
difficult to use, because of their arrangement of Lessons in the succession
ordered by the calendar: they are of course public documents, and in
consequence possess an importance above that of copies which were in
many cases the property of private persons, and may have been carelessly
and cheaply prepared. Yet it would not be right to claim for
copies of a version a position quite as important as that held by the
Greek service-books, since the evidence of versions, as well as of quotations
in ancient writers, is only subsidiary. Nevertheless, in the fact
that the number of ancient Greek copies of the New Testament is relatively
small as compared with the early copies of the Peshitto version,
we are warned not to underrate Syriac Lectionaries, though they are of
less value for the Syriac, on account of the large number of very ancient
and well-written copies which have come down to us, such as those which
have been enumerated in our account of the materials for ascertaining
the text of the Peshitto.

everywhere, and must have been constantly supplied. On the one hand the
bilingualism prevalent in the Roman Empire would ensure a large number of
translators: and on the other the want of accurate Greek scholarship would
account for the numerous errors found in and propagated by the old Latin
manuscripts. Copies of one translation could not in those days have been
supplied in every place adequately to the want;
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Because of the multitude of synonyms to be found in Old Latin MSS.;

a convincing case, for the Hebrew origin of St. Matthew's Gospel, and thus far
his argument is plausible enough. To demonstrate that the version he has
discovered is based upon that Hebrew original, at least so far as to be a modification
of it and not a translation from the Greek, he has but a single plea that will
bear examination, viz. that out of the many readings of the Hebrew or Nazarene
Gospel with which we are acquainted, his manuscript agrees with it in the one
particular of inserting the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three kings</span></em>, ch. i. 8, though even here the number of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fourteen</span></em> generations retained in ver. 17 shows them to be an interpolation. Such
cases as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juda</span></span>, ch. ii. 1; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ramtha</span></span>, ver. 18; ܕ for ὅτι or the relative, ch. xiii. 16,
can prove nothing, as they are common to the Curetonian with the Peshitto,
from which version they may very well have been derived.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_16" name="note_16" href="#noteref_16">16.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The title to St. Matthew is remarkable; for while (in the subscription) we
read, <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of Markos,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of Juchanan”</span> occurs, as in other Syriac
MSS., to St. Matthew is prefixed the title <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangeliom dampharsa Mattai.”</span> The
meaning of the second word is doubtful in this application. The root means
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">divide</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">distinguish</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">separate</span></span>—cf. Daniel v. 28. Cureton (Pref. vi) says (1) that the
great authority Bernstein suggested <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangelium per anni circulum dispositum.”</span>
This is inapplicable, because the copy is not set out in Church Lessons, although
some are noted by a much later hand in the margins. (2) Cureton himself,
noticing a defect in the vellum before ܡܬܝ (or ܝܬܡ), would read ܕܡܬܝ (or ܝܬܡܕ), and render
<span class="tei tei-q">“The distinct Gospel of Matthew.”</span> This he understood to indicate that the
translation of Matthew had a different origin from the other books, and was <span class="tei tei-q">“built
upon the original Aramaic text, which was the work of the Apostle himself.”</span>
But there is nothing to justify the insertion of a ܕ, which is required to connect
the title with the following name. The title belongs to the whole work,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Evangeliom dampharsa—Mattai”</span> [Catalogue Brit. Mus. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l. c.</span></span>]; the other names
being preceded by <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangeliom”</span> only. (3) <span class="tei tei-q">“Dampharsa”</span> has been rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">“explained”</span> [see the review in <span class="tei tei-q">“Journal of Sacred Literature,”</span> 1858], viz. from the
text of the Peshitto; and this, as we shall see presently, agrees with the
character of the Curetonian, for it abounds in deliberate alterations. But (4)
from the quotations and references in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Thesaurus Syriacus”</span> (R. Payne Smith),
col. 3304, it seems almost certain that the epithet means <span class="tei tei-q">“separated,”</span> as opposed
to <span class="tei tei-q">“united in a Harmony.”</span> Such, of course, the Codex Curetonianus is, but

Tattam in 1842 and Canon Cureton, some Textualists have maintained that it
was older than the Peshitto on these main grounds:—
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Internal evidence proves that the Peshitto cannot have been the original
text.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Curetonian is just such a text as may have been so, and would have
demanded revision.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The parallels of the Latin texts which were revised in the Vulgate suggests
an authoritative revision between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and 350.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These arguments depend upon a supposed historical parallel, and internal
evidence.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The parallel upon examination turns out to be illusory:—
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. There was a definite recorded revision of the Latin Texts, but none of the
Syrian. If there had been, it must have left a trace in history.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. There was an <span class="tei tei-q">“infinita varietas”</span> (August. De Doctr. Christ., ii. 11) of discordant
Latin texts, but only one Syriac, so far as is known.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Badness in Latin texts is just what we should expect amongst people who
were poor Greek scholars, and lived at a distance. The Syrians on the
contrary were close to Judea, and Greek had been known among them
for centuries. It was not likely that within reach of the Apostles and
almost within their lifetime a version should be made so bad as to
require to be thrown off afterwards.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to internal evidence, the opinion of some experts is balanced by the
opinion of other experts (see Abbé Martin, Des Versions Syriennes, Fasc. 4).
The position of the Peshitto as universally received by Syrian Christians, and
believed to date back to the earliest times, is not to be moved by mere conjecture,
and a single copy of another version [or indeed by two copies].

p. 27) as a MS. of the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark, is really a selection of
passages taken in order from the four Gospels, with a patristic catena attached
to each. The leaves, however, are much displaced in the binding, and many
are wanting. The title to the first Gospel is ϯ ⲉⲣⲙⲏⲛⲓⲁ ⲛⲧⲉ ⲡⲓⲉⲩⲁⲅⲅⲉⲗⲓⲟⲛ
ⲉⲑⲟⲩⲁⲃ ⲕⲁⲧⲁ ⲙⲁⲑⲉⲟⲛ ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲓⲧⲉⲛ

&amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“The interpretation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew from numerous
doctors and luminaries of the Church.”</span> Among the Fathers quoted I observed
Athanasius, Basil, Chrysostom, Clement, the two Cyrils (of Jerusalem and of
Alexandria), Didymus, Epiphanius, Eusebius, Evagrius, the three Gregories
(Thaumaturgus, Nazianzen, and Nyssen), Hippolytus, Irenaeus, Severianus of
Gabala, Severus of Antioch (often styled simply the Patriarch), Symeon Stylites,
Timotheus, and Titus.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the account of this MS. in the Catalogue it is stated that <span class="tei tei-q">“the name of the
scribe who wrote it is Sapita Leporos, a monk of the monastery, or monastic
rule, of Laura under the sway of the great abbot Macarius,”</span> and the inference
is thence drawn that it must have been written before 395, when Macarius died.
This early date, however, is at once set aside by the fact that writers who lived in
the sixth century are quoted. Professor Wright (Journal of Sacred Literature, vii.
p. 218), observing the name of Severus in the facsimile, points out the error of
date, and suggests as an explanation that the colophon (which he had not seen)
does not speak of the great Macarius, but of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an abbot</span></em> Macarius.”</span> The fact is,
that though the great Macarius is certainly meant, there is nothing which
implies that he was then living. The scribe describes himself as ⲁⲛⲟⲕ ϧⲁ
ⲡⲓ ⲧⲁⲗⲉⲡⲱⲣⲟⲥ ⲉⲧⲁϥⲥϧⲁⲓ, <span class="tei tei-q">“I the unhappy one (ταλαιπωρος) who
wrote it”</span> (which has been wrongly read and interpreted as a proper name Sapita
Leporos). He then gives his name ⲑⲉⲟⲗ ⲡⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲓ (Theodorus of Busiris?)
and adds, ⲡⲓⲁⲧⲙⲡϣⲁ ⲙⲙⲟⲛⲁⲭⲟⲥ ⲛⲧⲉ ϯⲗⲁⲩⲣⲁ
ⲉⲑⲟⲩⲁⲃ ⲛⲧⲉ ⲡⲓⲛⲓϣϯ ⲁⲃⲃⲁ ⲙⲁⲕⲁⲣⲓ, <span class="tei tei-q">“the unworthy monk
of the holy laura of the great abbot Macarius.”</span> He was merely an inmate of the
monastery of St. Macarius; see the expression quoted from the Vat. MS. lxi in
Tattam's Lexicon, p. 842. This magnificent MS. is dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.m.</span></span> 604 = <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 888

The *Parham MS. 106 (no. 5, p. 28) is wrongly described as containing the

is not Biblical. Another MS. (no. 13, p. 29) is described as <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Matthew with

Erasmus in his Annotations fairly confesses what he did: <span class="tei tei-q">“quanquam in calce
hujus libri, nonnulla verba reperi apud nostros, quae aberant in Graecis exemplaribus,
ea tamen ex latinis adjecimus.”</span> But since the text and commentary
in Cod. Reuchlini are so mixed up as to be undistinguishable in parts without
the aid of a second manuscript (Tregelles' <span class="tei tei-q">“Delitzsch's Handschriftliche Funde,”</span>
Part ii. pp. 2-7), it is no wonder that in other places Erasmus in his perplexity
was sometimes tempted to translate into his own Greek from the Latin Vulgate
such words or clauses as he judged to have been wrongly passed over by his
sole authority, e.g. ch. ii. 2, 17; iii. 5, 12, 15; vi. 11, 15 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> under Apoc. 1); vii.
17; xiii. 4, 5; xiv. 16; xxi. 16; xxii. 11, where the Greek words only of Erasmus
are false; while in ch. ii. 3; v. 14 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></span>); vi. 1, 3, 5, 7; xiii. 10; xiv. 5
(as partly in xxii. 14), he was misled by the recent copies of the Vulgate,
whereto alone he had access, to make additions which no Greek manuscript is
known to support. Bengel's acuteness had long before suspected that ch. v.
14; xxii. 11, and the form ἀκαθάρτητος, ch. xvii. 4 (where Apoc. 1 has τὰ ἀκάθαρτα)
had their origin in no Greek copy, but in the Vulgate. Nor does Apoc. 1
lend any countenance to ch. xvii. 8, καίπερ ἔστι, or to ver. 13, διαδιδώσουσιν.
For Erasmus' πληρώσονται ch. vi. 11, Apoc. 1 has πληρώσωσιν, the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">impleantur</span></span>;

He corrects a few obvious misprints of Elzevir 1633, but his note shows that
he does not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intend</span></em> to read τῷ in Mark vi. 29. The following seem to be deliberate

1 Tim. iii. 2, 11 (yet not Tit. ii. 2); Philem. 7; 1 Pet. i. 3; iii. 7. All these
deliberate variations are found in Von Mastricht's edition of 1735, which seems
to have been used by Wetstein as the basis of his text; and in all of them
(except Matt. xxi. 41; Luke xi. 12, and Phil. iii. 5) Fell's text agrees with
Wetstein's. In Matt. xiii. 15; Mark xiv. 54; 1 Cor. i. 29; v. 11; xii. 23; xiv.

Armenian, and Latin versions and Fathers, and Origen in four places (ἀθῶον

Harkleian; the Jerusalem may countenance him; though in such a case the
testimony of versions is precarious on either side. Here, however, Griesbach

habit to copy Griesbach's lists of critical authorities (errors, misprints, and all)
without giving the reader any warning that they were not the fruit of his own
labours. The note he borrowed from Griesbach on 1 Tim. iii. 16, contains the
words <span class="tei tei-q">“uti docuimus in Symbolis Criticis:”</span> this too Scholz appropriates (Tom.
ii. p. 334, col. 2) so as to claim the <span class="tei tei-q">“Symbolae Criticae”</span> of the Halle Professor as
his own! See also p. 217, Evan. 365; p. 253, Act. 86, and Tischendorf's notes on
Acts xix. 25; 2 Pet. i. 15 (N. T., eighth edition). His very text must have been
set up by Griesbach's. Thus, since the latter, by a mere press error, omitted με
in 2 Cor. ii. 13, Scholz not only follows him in the omission, but cites in his note
a few cursives in which he had met with με, a word really absent from no known
copy. In Heb. ix. 5 again, both editors in error prefix τῆς to δόξης. Scholz's
inaccuracy in the description of manuscripts which he must have had before
him when he was writing is most wearisome to those who have had to trace his
steps, and to verify, or rather to falsify, his statements. He has half filled our
catalogues with duplicates and codices which are not Greek or are not Biblical
at all. After correcting not a few of his misrepresentations of books in the

completely extinct as (before Mr. Linwood's pamphlet) I had supposed. By a
dexterous interchange of letters of nearly the same form (Δ for Α, Ε for Σ, Ι for
Τ, Σ for Ε, κ for ΙΣ, Τ for Ι) this modern Bentley—and he well deserves the
name—suggests for ΑΣΤΕΙΟΣ τῷ θεῷ Act. vii. 20 [compare Heb. xi. 23] the
common-place ΔΕΚΤΟΣ τῷ θεῷ, from Act. x. 35. Each one of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six</span></em> necessary
changes Cobet profusely illustrates by examples, and even the reverse substitution
of δεκτός for ἀστεῖος from Alciphron: but in the absence of all manuscript
authority for the very smallest of these several permutations in Act. vii. 20, he
excites in us no other feeling than a sort of grudging admiration of his misplaced
ingenuity. In the same spirit he suggests ΗΔΕΙΟΝΑ for ΠΛΕΙΟΝΑ, Heb. xi. 4;
while in 1 Cor. ii. 4 for ἐν πειθοῖς σοφίας λόγοις he simply reads ἐν πειθοῖ σοφίας, the
σ which begins σοφίας having become accidentally doubled and λόγοις subsequently
added to explain πειθοῖς, which he holds to be no Greek word at all: it seems
indeed to be met with nowhere else. Dr. Hort's comment on this learned
trifling is instructive: <span class="tei tei-q">“Though it cannot be said that recent attempts in

clause, ἀρχείοις has been suggested as a substitute for the manuscript
reading ἀρχαίοις, and so the interpolators of the genuine Epistle have actually
written. But without denying that a play on the words was designed between
ἀρχαίοις and ἀρχεῖα, both copies of the Old Latin version maintain the distinction
made in the Medicean Greek (<span class="tei tei-q">“si non in veteribus invenio”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Mihi autem

line of distinction between his Alexandrian and Western recensions”</span> (An
Account of the Printed Text, p. 91). He certainly showed, throughout his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Commentarius Criticus,”</span> that Origen does not lend him the support he had once
anticipated; but he still held that the theory of a triple recension was the very
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hinge</span></em> on which the whole question turned, and clung to that theory as tenaciously
as ever. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Third Edition.</span></span> Dr. Hort (N. T., Introd. p. 186) has since confirmed

when its vote is against them. On analyzing the 908 readings for which R is
cited in Tischendorf's eighth edition, I find that it sides with A, the representative
of the one class, 356 times; with its better reputed rival B 157 times, where
A and B are at variance. It is with A alone of the great uncials 101 times, with
B alone four, with א alone five, with C alone (but C is lost in 473 places out of

I have carefully studied the chief criticisms which have been published on the

Epistles and sometimes in the Acts conspire with the best uncials in upholding
readings of the higher type: the other members are 69, 137, 182, to which will
sometimes be added the text or margin of the Harkleian Syriac, Codd. 27, 29,
the second hands of 57 and 66, 100, 180, 185, and particularly 221, which is
of special interest in these Epistles. The following passages, examined by
means of Tischendorf's notes, will prove what is here alleged: 1 Pet. iii. 16;
2 Pet. i. 4; 21; ii. 6; 11; 1 John i. 5; 7; 8; ii. 19; iii. 1; 19; 22; iv. 19; v. 5.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_321" name="note_321" href="#noteref_321">321.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Notice especially those instances in the Catholic Epistles, wherein the
primary authorities are comparatively few, in which Cod. B accords with the
later copies against Codd. אA(C), and is also supported by internal evidence:
e.g. 1 Pet. iii. 18; iv. 14; v. 2; 2 Pet. ii. 20; 1 John ii. 10; iii. 23, &amp;c. In
1 John iii. 21, where the first ἡμῶν is omitted by A and others, the second by C
almost alone, B seems right in rejecting the word in both places. So in other
cases internal probabilities occasionally plead strongly in favour of B, when it
has little other support: as in Rom. viii. 24, where τίς ἐλπίζει; as against
τις, τί καὶ ἐλπίζει; though B and the margin of Cod. 47 stand alone here, best
accounts for the existence of other variations (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg248" class="tei tei-ref">248</a>). In Eph. v. 22, B
alone, with Clement and Jerome, the latter very expressly, omits the verb in a
manner which can hardly fail to commend itself as representing the true form
of the passage. In Col. iii. 6, B, the Sahidic, the Roman Ethiopic, Clement
(twice), Cyprian, Ambrosiaster, and auct. de singl. cler., are alone free from the
clause interpolated from Eph. v. 6.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_322" name="note_322" href="#noteref_322">322.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Viz. Luke i. 1-4, some portion of the Gospel and most of the Acts: excluding

remains behind—proving that that Father was familiar with these verses. Also
he cites several passages from the Epistle of Barnabas in which traces of them
occur, and from the Quartodeciman controversy, and from Clement of Rome.
The value of the evidence which Dr. Taylor's acute vision has discovered consists
chiefly in its cumulative force. From familiarity with the passage numerous
traces of it arose; or as Dr. Taylor takes the case reversely, from the fact of the
occurrence of numerous traces evident to a close observer, it is manifest that
there pre-existed in the minds of the writers a familiarity with the language of
the verses in question.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_359" name="note_359" href="#noteref_359">359.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is surprising that Dr. Hort, who lays very undue stress upon the silence

constant confusion of ει and η at the period when the uncials were written
abundantly accounts for the reading of the few, though AC are among them.
In later times such itacisms were far more rare in careful transcription, and the
mediaeval copyists knew their native language too well to fall into the habit in

nearly all cursives, and the Complutensian edition, in the place of -σωνται of
Erasmus and the Received text; just as we have ἵνα γινώσκομεν in אAB*LP, 98,

an interesting puzzle with Biblical students. The manuscript, and especially
the leaf containing this verse (fol. 145), now very thin and falling into holes,
must have been in a widely different condition from the present when it first
came to England. At that period Young, Huish, and the rest who collated or
referred to it, believed that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> was written by the first hand. Mill (N. T. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad loc.</span></span>)
declares that he had first supposed the primitive reading to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span>, seeing clearly
that the line <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">over</span></em> the letters had not been entirely made, but only thickened, by
a later hand, probably the same that traced the coarse, rude, recent, horizontal
diameter now running through the circle. On looking more closely, however,
he detected <span class="tei tei-q">“ductus quosdam et vestigia satis certa ... praesertim ad partem
sinistram, qua peripheriam literae pertingit,”</span> evidently belonging to an earlier
diameter, which the thicker and later one had almost defaced. This old line
was afterwards seen by John Berriman and four other persons with him
(Gloucester Ridley, Gibson, Hewett, and Pilkington) by means of a glass in the

of such a transverse line, but referred it to the tongue or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sagitta</span></span> of Ε on the

quite true, and yet not relevant to the point at issue. In an Excursus appended
to 1 Timothy in his edition of <span class="tei tei-q">“The Pastoral Epistles”</span> (p. 100, 1856), Bp. Ellicott
declares, as the result of <span class="tei tei-q">“minute personal inspection,”</span> that the original reading
was <span class="tei tei-q">“indisputably”</span> ΟΣ. But the fact is, that the page is much too far gone to
admit of any present judgement which would weigh against past judgements,

of difference between Codex Montfortianus (34) and Erasmus' printed text are
two, viz. that 34 omits καί after πνεῦμα in ver. 8, and with the Complutensian
leaves out its last clause altogether; while, on the other hand, Erasmus and
Cod. 34 agree against the Complutensian in their barbarous neglect of the Greek
article in both verses. As regards the omission in Cod. 34 of the last clause of
ver. 8 (καὶ οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὸ ἕν εἰσιν), it is obvious to conjecture that the person,
whosoever he was, that sent the transcript of the passage to Erasmus, who
never saw the MS. for himself, might have broken off after copying the disputed
words, and neglected to note down the further variation that immediately
followed them. After the foregoing explanation we must leave the matter as it
stands, for there is no known mode of accounting for the discrepancy, whereof
Mr. Forster makes the very utmost in the following note, which, as a specimen
of his book, is annexed entire: <span class="tei tei-q">“Bishop Marsh labours hard to identify the
Codex Britannicus used by Erasmus, with the Codex Montfortianus. Erasmus's
own description of the Codex Britannicus completely nullifies the attempt:
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Postremo: Quod Britannicum etiam in terrae testimonio addebat, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς
εἰς τὸ ἕν εἰσι, quod non addebatur hic duntaxat in editione Hispaniensi.’</span> Now
as this clause is also omitted in the Montfort Codex, it cannot possibly be the
same with the Codex Britannicus. In this as yet undiscovered MS., therefore,
we have a second and independent Gr. MS. witness to the seventh verse. The
zeal of the adversaries to evade this fact only betrays their sense of its importance”</span>

them, and yet I must say that if the former lost a legacy (as has been reported)
by publishing his <span class="tei tei-q">“Letters,”</span> he was entitled to but slender sympathy. The prejudices
of good men (especially when a passage is concerned which they have
long held to be a genuine portion of Scripture, clearly teaching pure and right
doctrine) should be dealt with gently: not that the truth should be dissembled
or withheld, but when told it ought to be in a spirit of tenderness and love.
Now take one example out of fifty of the tone and temper of Porson. The immediate
question was a very subordinate one in the controversy, namely, the
evidence borne by the Acts of the Lateran Council, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1215. <span class="tei tei-q">“Though this,”</span>
rejoins Porson, <span class="tei tei-q">“proves nothing in favour of the verse, it proves two other
points. That the clergy then exercised dominion over the rights of mankind,

that given in the text: <span class="tei tei-q">“St. John,”</span> he suggests, <span class="tei tei-q">“is distinguishing between the
mere recipient of the new birth (ὁ γεννηθεὶς ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ),—and the man who
